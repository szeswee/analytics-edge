"North America's integrated electricity market requires cooperation on environmental policies Commission for Environmental Cooperation releases working paper on North America's electricity market Montreal, 27 November 2001 -- The North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is releasing a working paper highlighting the trend towards increasing trade, competition and cross-border investment in electricity between Canada, Mexico and the United States. It is hoped that the working paper, Environmental Challenges and Opportunities in the Evolving North American Electricity Market, will stimulate public discussion around a CEC symposium of the same title about the need to coordinate environmental policies trinationally as a North America-wide electricity market develops. The CEC symposium will take place in San Diego on 29-30 November, and will bring together leading experts from industry, academia, NGOs and the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States to consider the impact of the evolving continental electricity market on human health and the environment. ""Our goal [with the working paper and the symposium] is to highlight key environmental issues that must be addressed as the electricity markets in North America become more and more integrated,"" said Janine Ferretti, executive director of the CEC. ""We want to stimulate discussion around the important policy questions being raised so that countries can cooperate in their approach to energy and the environment."" The CEC, an international organization created under an environmental side agreement to NAFTA known as the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, was established to address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and promote the effective enforcement of environmental law. The CEC Secretariat believes that greater North American cooperation on environmental policies regarding the continental electricity market is necessary to: *  protect air quality and mitigate climate change, *  minimize the possibility of environment-based trade disputes, *  ensure a dependable supply of reasonably priced electricity across North America *  avoid creation of pollution havens, and *  ensure local and national environmental measures remain effective. The Changing Market The working paper profiles the rapid changing North American electricity market. For example, in 2001, the US is projected to export 13.1 thousand gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity to Canada and Mexico. By 2007, this number is projected to grow to 16.9 thousand GWh of electricity. ""Over the past few decades, the North American electricity market has developed into a complex array of cross-border transactions and relationships,"" said Phil Sharp, former US congressman and chairman of the CEC's Electricity Advisory Board. ""We need to achieve this new level of cooperation in our environmental approaches as well."" The Environmental Profile of the Electricity Sector The electricity sector is the single largest source of nationally reported toxins in the United States and Canada and a large source in Mexico. In the US, the electricity sector emits approximately 25 percent of all NOx emissions, roughly 35 percent of all CO2 emissions, 25 percent of all mercury emissions and almost 70 percent of SO2 emissions. These emissions have a large impact on airsheds, watersheds and migratory species corridors that are often shared between the three North American countries. ""We want to discuss the possible outcomes from greater efforts to coordinate federal, state or provincial environmental laws and policies that relate to the electricity sector,"" said Ferretti. ""How can we develop more compatible environmental approaches to help make domestic environmental policies more effective?"" The Effects of an Integrated Electricity Market One key issue raised in the paper is the effect of market integration on the competitiveness of particular fuels such as coal, natural gas or renewables. Fuel choice largely determines environmental impacts from a specific facility, along with pollution control technologies, performance standards and regulations. The paper highlights other impacts of a highly competitive market as well. For example, concerns about so called ""pollution havens"" arise when significant differences in environmental laws or enforcement practices induce power companies to locate their operations in jurisdictions with lower standards. ""The CEC Secretariat is exploring what additional environmental policies will work in this restructured market and how these policies can be adapted to ensure that they enhance competitiveness and benefit the entire region,"" said Sharp. Because trade rules and policy measures directly influence the variables that drive a successfully integrated North American electricity market, the working paper also addresses fuel choice, technology, pollution control strategies and subsidies. The CEC will use the information gathered during the discussion period to develop a final report that will be submitted to the Council in early 2002.

Modern Metals, July 2001 Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas 07/13/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing Facilities MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis. The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system. ""Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,"" said Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern Natural Gas. ""This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved."" ""We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market,"" said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. ""The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers."" As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline. ""This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers,"" said George Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. ""The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace."" The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the construction of Guardian Pipeline. Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise By Mark Long and Steve McGrath Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 07/13/2001 Dow Jones Commodities Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton. An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in later trade. Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday. Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. The opposite situation is called contango. ""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London. Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. ""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,"" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, brokers said. However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, they said. On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing countries are also expected to fall. Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and dollar-denominated grains on the world market. -By Mark Long and Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9358; mark.long@dowjones.com Copyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, dealers said. (LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80) An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton.

In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. ""The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise,"" said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to significantly improve market sentiment. ""A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being,"" Barclays said in a market report. Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on technicals. Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton support but still closed at its lowest level since April. Nickel's fall was ""just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, mostly chart-based,"" Bhar said. -By Mark Long, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9356; mark.long@dowjones.com Copyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads. By Camila Reed 07/13/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from Wednesday's 16-week low. Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p. The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, having streaked up in the previous session. Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying opportunity for UK equities. DRUGS SEE-SAW Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over one percent. Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical play. Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by four points. FTSE MIXED PICTURE But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a lapse in consumer confidence. ""This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile but it does show the potential of the market,"" said Foreign & Colonial director of UK equities David Manning. ""It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the temptation is to do very little,"" he said. ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. TECHS DIP Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent jump. The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper deal to combine the companies. The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct) 2001-07-13 08:48 (New York) Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct) (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of story that moved yesterday.) New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades. The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as 98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said. ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large price swings. The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming. Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog. The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33 billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have said they would trade the futures. New Plants Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at least 1989. So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri- based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based PacifiCorp. Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with federal and local environmental regulations. Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp. ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he said. Big Sandy The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550 tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and possibly Europe. The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production, including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3 and 4 coal producers. The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production, including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming. Avoiding the Past The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which debuted in May 2000. ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois. ``It came out sort of on target.'' Most of today's trading was originated by large energy marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility holding company, have said they would trade coal futures. Exchange officials have said the coal market has the potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading. The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas contract averages about 33,500. Wary of Coal ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the market to take off. Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be active as well. ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the industry to sell them to, he said. ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.'' Modern Metals, July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a ""non-event."" By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word ""Enron"" in a room full of metals executives is like screaming ""fire"" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a ""b""), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as ""annoyances""), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in ""uninformed investment decisions"" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. Enron contends that it can act as a ""risk intermediary"" in steel transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. ""Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,"" McMahon stated, ""and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."" The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for $225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. ""It's a big portfolio,"" McMahon said. ""We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business."" Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year ""physical off take"" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. ""What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment,"" he stated. ""I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at $200 a ton."" Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article. ""If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], great,"" he said. ""But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your throat."" For the service centers Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. ""The only way [distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,"" he explained. ""That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. ""We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers,"" he continued, ""so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somewhat certain."" ""I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . "" commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he pointed out that ""how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some people and a non-event for others."" Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, ""One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals.""  In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in orders, but no releases, and a ""don't call us, we'll call you"" attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reductions on the way down and on the way up. ""If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market,"" he concluded, ""that would be a very big plus for the steel industry."" But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, ""trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we need right now,"" he declared, ""somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars."" But, he recognized, ""we're all going to have to deal with it."" Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the so-called ""low-hanging fruit"" of the steel market in the current economy. ""What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items?"" he queried. ""My concern would be that the price would go up on [those items]."" McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. ""In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment,"" he related. ""Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?"" Only just begun Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, ""are they ready to deal with problems?"" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave Lerman explained, ""I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to implement."" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. ""Most customers require better than standard tolerances,"" he pointed out. ""These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales."" Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, ""the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?"" Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. ""They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a U.S. customer,"" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the LME, will be in hedging. ""You may see some [physical transactions] to start with,"" Bradford predicted, ""just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see that as the way the market will develop."" McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. ""We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so,"" he said. ""It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'."" The jury is still out on just how soon that ""when"" will come, and what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don McNeeley recounted, ""I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."" ***********",1

For the nervous, there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps -- including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them. That company is Houston-based Enron Corp., and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but aren't. Enron is one of the world's largest energy companies, with a market value of about $45-billion (U.S.) and interests in electric power generation, natural gas production, pipelines and related industries. But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business -- the fibre-optic information pipeline business. Not only does it own a massive fibre network, but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading. Not that long ago, Enron was a sleepy old energy utility -- much like TransCanada PipeLines, for example. Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibre-optic bandwidth . Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years, he expects the bandwidth market ""will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets,"" or about $300-billion. It didn't take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks: that is, ready-made routes. Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market, having hit on the idea of laying fibre-optic cables along his railway rights-of-way -- an idea that became a $30-billion company called Qwest Communications (which is merging with US West). Williams Cos. had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines, and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in 1995 for $2.5-billion. The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications. In Canada, Alberta-based construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail, and sold access to phone and Internet companies. That business became 360Networks, a separate unit that is expected to go public this week. So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge (formerly IPL) and Westcoast while all this was going on? Well, Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company, and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project, and then they decided to merge, in one of the world's all-time worst merger deals. Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year. Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests, and they have both done a good job of it -- but they remain tied to fundamentally low-margin businesses. Enron has swung for the fences, and that's why its stock has climbed from the $45 range last fall to about $65. Given its exposure to technology, Enron has suffered a little bit lately. Enron isn't the only one building the pipes for the information industry, mind you. Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks, while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and 360Networks are building or buying them. Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PG&E, who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rights-of-way. Six other U.S. energy companies have a similar joint venture. With all this building, some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut, and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation. But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators -- and meanwhile, the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth -trading market. This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage. They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas. Enron , for example, is a leader in energy trading and risk management. What's so different about selling space on a fibre-optic pipeline? Not much. Can a single company explore, produce and ship natural gas, produce and sell electric power, and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time? That remains to be seen, but Enron appears determined to try -- and that's why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become ""the General Electric of the New Economy."" ***********",0

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model. (The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the ""hour-ahead"" process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the models for the region.

"Kevin, I'm sorry, Kevin.  I didn't realize the report was that long!  Here is a little synopsis.  I hope this helps you.  I haven't had time to read the report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it your way. Lorna CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated. Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage. -----Original Message----- From: 	Hyatt, Kevin Sent:	Tuesday, August 14, 2001 7:52 AM To:	Brennan, Lorna Subject:	RE: Draft Copy of CEC's Final Report on California Infrastructure can i have the Reader's Digest condensed version please!!!!!! -----Original Message----- From: 	Brennan, Lorna Sent:	Monday, August 13, 2001 10:54 AM To:	Chavez, Gabriel; Dowd, Stephen; Gadd, Eric; Hyatt, Kevin; Millar, John; Ratner, Michael; Taylor, Gina; Hass, Glen; Loeffler, Michael; Stanton, Lon; Wilson, Rob; Harris, Steven; Donoho, Lindy; Goradia, Pallavi; Lindberg, Lorraine; Lohman, TK; Lokay, Michelle; Moore, Jan; Watson, Kimberly; Huber, Lee; Pryor, Tony Subject:	Draft Copy of CEC's Final Report on California Infrastructure << File: cec.infrastructure.pdf >> ***********",1

They've recently obtained a City of Farmington pledge of public funds (a precursor to a formal bond issue) to underpin the financing. To refresh your memory, this project is another ""trigeneration"" project.  Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm, as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide.  We've previously provided a route map and estimate (0.75 mi. of 4"" pipe, $486K direct/indirect cost) to Ameramex. Ameramex's financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx. 7 months.  To this end, Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised (if necessary) estimate of the cost to interconnect.  There are several other issues to be dealt with here, including what is the final deal structure; including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds. Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations and/or engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate design/configuration of facilities.  Depending on the outcome of the survey, he'd like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities. Ron, since you provided all the prior facility planning support, I'd like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project.  I'll also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you and engineering to optimize the design/routing of this interconnect/lateral pipeline.  I'll work with the customer to set-up a site meeting when you return to work after 2/5/01. To bring you and others up to speed, I've included a couple of the original email(s) giving a little more detail on the estimate and a map of the route: Ronald Matthews 06/16/2000 03:32 PM To:	Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc:	Terry Galassini/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Team San-Juan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	Amerimex Energy Farms Project Jeff, I talked with the San Juan team and came up with a pipeline route to the proposed Energy Farms site located in S1/2  SE1/4  Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, and the NE1/2  NE1/4 Sec. 24, T29N, R11W all in San Juan County, NM.  Per the correspondence, Energy Farms is looking at a delivery around 15 MMcf/d.  The best approach to serving this load would be to take gas from the suction side of Bloomfield CS.  The 4"" pipeline would start there a travel about 0.75 miles to the northwest section of the proposed site (see attached map).  A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TW's property along with the other meter facilities.  Below is a breakdown of the facility cost.  Estimated costs are + 30% and would have to be refined. 0.75 miles of 4"" pipeline & side valve		$286,500 4"" orifice meter run w/ gallagher flow 		$199,900 conditioner, & flow control $486,400 There is a possibility that the meter facility costs could be lower by using an existing metering header system but a more detailed review would be required.  Please feel free to call if you have any questions.  I will send you a copy of the estimated costs for both the pipeline and measurement since they can't be attached.

Rick works for a company called Amerimex.  Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG (""the early years"").  Amerimex is a developer of ""trigeneration"" projects.  In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield, another one is being considered for Santa Theresa, N.M.  If you recall, we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup. Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the ""byproducts"" of electric generation.  ""Cogeneration"" refers to the process where waste heat/steam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially (usually to manufacturing facilities) for plant purposes.  ""Trigeneration,"" on the other hand, refers the process where not only is the waste heat/steam utilized, but also the carbon dioxide.  Therefore, trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants. Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield, N.M. area.  The facility, to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies, would have a nominal rating of 70 MW, resulting in a gas burn of about 15 MMcf/d.  The plant would require gas deliveries at approx. 500 psig.  The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates 69kv transmission line that is proximate to the site.  Given the ""politically correct"" nature of these facilities, the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a $70MM bond. As you can see, we're in the very earliest stages of conversation.  We'll keep the group posted on progress. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 04/18/2000 10:38 AM --------------------------- Jeffery Fawcett 04/18/2000 10:38 AM To:	rmoore01@elp.rr.com cc:	Ronald Matthews/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	Amerimex Bloomfield Project Rick, It was really great visiting with you the other day.  It never ceases to amaze me how small a world this is.  I hope this project moves forward and we get the opportunity to work together again. Attached for your use is the schematic you spoke with Ron Matthews about.  It's not too terribly detailed, so I don't know if it will be useful or not.  We have much more detailed images of the Bloomfield area on our alignments, but without a legal description, we're a little blind. I don't know if you've had a chance to get the legal description for the proposed plant site yet or not, but if you have it, would you forward that on to me?  We could then get started at not only putting together a rough cost estimate for the tap and meter, but we could begin looking for the best route for a lateral line between the facilities. Look forward to hearing from you soon. ***********",1

The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary. As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30"" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal. If any or all the company's who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service. Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West.

Printer-friendly version LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market.  Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs), Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), Mirant Corp. (MIR, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs) have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power - the ability to influence electricity prices - in California's wholesale power market. The ISO, which manages the state's high-voltage transmission system, recently made a similar filing against AES Corp. (AES, news, msgs) and Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power.  The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators' authority to charge market-based rates for their power supply. Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy, said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations.  ""We've obviously just got the filing and we're reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing. But we're also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down,"" Williams said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said the ISO's allegations are ""nothing new.""  ""It's similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators,"" Wheatley said. ""The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief. The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand. The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing."" Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor ""strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market."" The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June 28 Dynegy's ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy company's production costs.  The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars, retroactive to May 1, ""of the difference between cost-based rates...and the market revenues actually received.""  Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke, Reliant and Mirant. ""The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged...,"" according to the filing.  In the filing, generators have also been accused of ""megawatt-laundering,"" in which suppliers sell power out-of-state that is resold to California at a higher price. California consumers have spent $7 billion for wholesale electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and could pay as much as $50 billion this year. Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel, said he is ""optimistic"" the state will prevail ""in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief we're seeking.""  He said FERC should implement an ""effective"" market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices.  FERC set up a market mitigation plan, which went into effect June 1, to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below 7%. Robinson said that plan wasn't good enough. Wholesale power prices were at a seven-month low Thursday, due in part to the new FERC plan, cooler temperatures, low natural-gas prices, and conservation measures, energy officials said. Every three years, FERC reviews generators' ability to charge market rates for electricity. Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago, but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices. ***********",1

"Melissa, As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly ""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value. January- Total Accrual Value = $266,504 Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid = $105,000 Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000) Total Value =                                   $148,750 February- Total Accrual Value = $289,305 Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid = $100,000 Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000) Total Value =                                   $177,000 March - Total Accrual Value = $292,145 Greg's Value       Tom's Value Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid = $106,000 Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs =       $13,000 Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000) Total Value =                                   $172,000 Let me know if you have any questions.

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to become familiar with this data extraction process.

"John, With regard to your first question, yes there are additional design capacities to be considered. The Topock lateral, which consists of the three Topock points listed, has a capacity of 400 MDth/d.  Additionally, the mainline capacity going west, which serves ALL of our markets in Arizona as well as California, is at 1090 MDth/d. As for your second question, the data fields that were highlighted in red were more for my reference since these required some manual review/correction on my part.

Obviously, we have a problem. Northern's actions over the last 10 days have been reckless, completely unacceptable and in violation of MEC's agreements, NNG's tariff and many years of operational precedent. In addition to the financial risk that NNG is assuming resulting from supply allocations it has implemented based on hourly flow, NNG's restriction of MEC flow within its firm rights elevates NNG's risk to an extreme level. Under certain circumstances, the actions that NNG has recently demonstrated may result in the loss of service to a portion of MEC's distribution system. The fact that neither you, members of your staff nor NNG operations personnel have been able to explain to any degree of specificity or accuracy the new operating practices that NNG has unilaterally and abruptly implemented is unconscionable. Accordingly, I have no alternative other than to request that NNG meet the specific requirements of its tariff (including but not limited to Section 19.A.6) by providing MEC with all information, including affidavits, explaining in detail NNG's restriction of flow and/or supply allocations on each day from May 30 through June 8. Please also consider this correspondence as a request for the same information  related to any future day where NNG takes such action. As always, I am available to discuss MEC's position in detail.

This was around 1915.  Around 2030 the control valves started fighting each other again.  I waited for a while to see if they would settle down.  They didn't.  I called NNG control (Richard) and requested he set in a slightly higher set point to help alleviate the problem.  He refused.  He said their orders were to set in 50,000/day (2083/hr) and not to exceed it.  I tried to explain that since we were under that hourly average earlier in the day he needed to set his a little higher so we could get in all the gas.  He refused.  I used a set point of 2083/hr to match NNG's and hopefully get the control valves in sync.  Therefore we are not going to hit our target without doing a storage netting nom in the A.M.  The soap opera continues....................... Thanks, Mikey ***********",1

"Phase 2 testimony is due May 26, 2000 and addresses rate design issues Rate design and ratemaking proposals submitted in testimony should follow the principles: 1. provide for fair cost allocation among customers; 2. allow the utility distribution companies (UDCs) adequate cost recovery while minimizing costs to consumers; 3. facilitate customer-side distributed generation deployment; and send proper price signals to prospective purchasers of distributed generation. Testimony should identify how current rate structures and those proposed in other Commission proceedings may prevent or hinder deployment of distributed generation, and how rate structures could be modified to facilitate distributed generation deployment.  Parties should discuss the interrelationship among rate design issues:  stranded costs, bypass, demand, customer and grid charges, standby rates, and PBR and flexible pricing mechanisms. Additionally, rate design issues related to interconnection costs should be addressed.  Issues include cost recovery and allocation, such as who should pay for costs to interconnect to the distribution system and for interconnection studies, or if costs incurred by the first distributed generation customers on a specific circuit or feeder should be shared by subsequent distributed generation customers connecting to the same facilities. The attachment (Attachment A) provides 36 questions and a framework for the issues the Commission will consider in Phase 2 of this proceeding. See attached ruling for details. ***********",1

"In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d. ""Norman A.

"Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles but does not extend the same privilege to TW. I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any questions or comments to discuss! S. ***********",1

"Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it. My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as ""firm"" or ""interruptible"" since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM is comfortable with all this before we file anything. Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15. ***********",0

"I will most likely not be able to attend.  However, my comment relating to this issue was a generalization of confidentiality clauses I've used on other interconnect agreements and other contracts, including the ""model"" interconnection agreement recently submitted to FERC by EPSA.  In essence, the issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to disclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in connection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility output, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and maintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail customer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential information between the generator and retail customer).  This information is potentially competitive and should be held confidential.  Potential wording for a simplified confidentiality section would be as follows: ""Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or other provisions of law or as otherwise provided for in this Rule, the Electic Provider shall hold in confidence any and all documents and information furnished by the Electric Customer in connection with the interconnection, provide however, that to the extent it is necessary for the the EP to release or disclose such information to a third party in order to perform the EP's obligation herein, EP shall advise said third party of the confidential provisons of this Rule and use its best efforts to require said third party to agree in writing to comply with such provisions.""

"I wanted to bring to this group's attention the Maryland PSC staff's comments regarding BGE's standby service proposal.  The proposal in its current form is a result of numerous settlement meetings among BGE, staff, Enron, Trigen (a developer of on-site generation), and several large industrial customers. In staff's comments, it talks about the DG-related issues raised -- but not addressed -- by BGE's filing, and it encourages the Commission to adopt state-wide policies to promote a vibrant competitive market for DG services.   Harry -- it appears that our many hours spent educating the staff (and others) on DG issues was well worth the time.   Significantly, staff states in its comments that: ""A third issue that can impact the adoption of DG services is that of interconnection policies.  Interconnection policy differences between the IOUs (statewide) can significantly retard the development of a vibrant DG industry for services to customers.  As with other aspects of electric restructuring, Staff believes that common accepted rules that have statewide applicability will promote electric services competition.  Hence, the adoption of &one8 set of interconnection standards could provide a good incentive for developing a DG services market in Maryland.  Staff believes that eventually, the State of Maryland may need to adopt 'a proposed' set of interconnection standards that apply Statewide."" Further, staff talks about the benefits of DG: ""Increasing the use of DG services could help Customers by decreasing their costs and adding flexibility to their use of electricity services.  Some parties could argue that increasing use of DG would also help BGE and allow it to avoid unneeded investments in T&D.  The net result would provide greater diversity of demand in the wire delivery system and improve overall electricity service efficiency.   Staff is of the opinion that a fuller adoption of DG services is a positive development, which can provide benefits to customers of BGE as well as the IOUs, in terms of avoided (and perhaps unnecessary) investments in T&D, and also provide benefits to the State of Maryland in terms of a more efficient electric service industry, including environmental benefits."" Please let me know if you would like a copy of BGE's standby filing.

The vote was 3 to 2, with Bilas and Duque voting ""no"". Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues, the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh. The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I am assuming that the ""average rate increase"" refers to the average across TOU periods. I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary tomorrow.

"rstalter@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the request of Steven Keller of the NY PSC: Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six Months to One Month The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns. A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain ""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices. In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to significantly higher deficiency charges under a one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose. As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to shortening the OPP. ***********",1

"Alrighty. Here is a complete look at what we have 'pending' with Alagasco. I'm expecting a call back next week from Amy McEntire (Alagasco's attorney) in regards to further instruction on what to do with the stragglers (outstanding deals). Based on my conversations today, it appears that Alagasco is showing these deals on other CES contracts (contracts for which we are encountering a volume constraint), if we can verify this via confirmations (Jennifer Blay is currently researching) then the issue will be volume constraints rather than term dates. TAMMI, can you verify if deal #s 242653 & 271301 are CES deals or ENA deals (there are no notes relating there back to CES)? If they are ENA deals, we should be able to move them over to the 'new' (9/1/99) Enfolio contract without the same tangles we are encountering with the CES continued deals. Also, can you confirm that these deals are not bound by a demand fee? Reason, the CES contracts stipulate demand fees (as listed on spreadsheet) - - - - - if the deals are ENA & do not have demand fees associated with them - - - - - - then they do not belong on the CES Ks and moving them should be easier (assuming that we are able to explain this to Alagasco as this will change the Confirming party & trigger a confirmation being sent to their offices). DAN, does all of this sound right to you? Depending on how Amy & Roger view things - - - - - - the move may just be a ENA booking issue. I'm a bit fearful that they may use this as an opportunity to renegotiate the demand fees associated with these long term deals. In addition, if they decide to allow the deals to ride on contracts where we encounter a volume constraint - - - - - - I'm assuming that they would initiate an amendment to reconciliate the contracts with the transactions. If they do not initiate - - - - - guess that will be a bridge crossed when we get there? Anyhow, TAMMI, I hope the spreadsheet helps if Roger should call before I hear from Amy. DAN, I'll let you know the volume issues as soon as I get my hands on copies of the confirmations that should have been sent by Alagasco. Depending on who gets contacted first - - - - - please let me know if anything new pops up. Thanks all!! Cyndie ***********",0

Enron signed a binding Letter Agreement (which included a fairly comprehensive Term Sheet) with Merchant on October 13, 1999.  A copy of this agreement is attached hereto. It was anticipated that the parties would execute a ""Definitive Agreement"", which would replace the Letter Agreement and contain a number of other terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon.  As a precaution, the Letter Agreement did outline a process to bring closure to this matter in case the parties could not agree. The parties did work together for several months on negotiating an ""LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement"", which added a considerable number of important provisions and modified a number of terms and conditions contained in the Letter Agreement for the benefit of both parties.  However, the Quality Letter Agreement, which is an attachment to the Letter Agreement, has become a major source of contention for two primary reasons: despite the fact that the parties did not intend to modify the Quality Letter Agreement, it is apparent to Enron, and indeed to Merchant, that this agreement does not position the Terminal with the capability of handling LNG from any meaningful number of LNG production sources in the world. Southern LNG, which is a party to the Quality Letter Agreement, has no intention of agreeing to meaningfully modify its Terminal, although something could be worked out if Enron were to eliminate a considerable portion of its flexibility and optionality in its sales arrangement with Merchant, an affiliate of Southern LNG. I am attaching a copy of the LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement, as it was last drafted in early July this year.  This draft does represent some considerable movement from the Letter Agreement, but we found it to be acceptable with the assumption that the quality issue would be favorably resolved.  This copy is in the comparewrite format, but I think you will be able to work your way through it for your purposes. When it recently became apparent that w would not be able to close with Merchant in terms acceptable to use, we decided we had better move back to the Term Sheet intent, even though both parties will realize some unattractive returns.  We have now drafted up the ""Definitive LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement', which we believe captures the full intent of the Letter Agreement and Term Sheet.  It is attached below for your review. Following your review of the pertinent aspects of these last two documents, we would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how, from a pricing point of view, they might be better restructured.

I talked to her immediately after we spoke and she assured my she was going to call immediately.  I did not spend much time on the phone with her but the little bit I did get was that she did not see that meter on any of her nomination reports and was not aware of any gas from them.  Also, generally, if a producer does not agree with a nomination from their supply points, they just don't confirm it.  If it was suppose to be confirmed, the phone calls will start at that time.

The document was forwarded to my attention for approval of some additional credit-related language that was included specifically for the transaction currently being executed.

The language to which I refer is found in Article 4.3, ""Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold"", and is highlighted in blue: ""Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Customer agree to negotiate in good faith a netting agreement that will eliminate or reduce the need for a letter of credit to be supplied by Customer and that until such netting agreement is executed by the parties, a Letter of Credit under this provision shall not be required.""

"Dan, I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of ""general terms and conditions"" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3) the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain ""Master Contract"" and ""Transaction Confirmation"".  These changes necessarily lead to more definitions. In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any changes you might like to make to our language. The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2 items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract had passed. For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim. However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is expected to take place in early April. I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

"teresa, charlie and dan will be getting us their standard reimbursement language letter.  when i receive this, i will pass on to you to look over.  we will still need the PDA waiver. joan -----Original Message----- From:  Quick, Joan Sent: Friday, April 06, 2001 3:52 PM To: Bushman, Teresa Subject: St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO] can you look into writing up the bold below. thanks -----Original Message----- From:  Joan Quick Sent: Friday, February 23, 2001 4:55 AM To: Phillip Ballard; Scott Josey; Jesus Melendrez; Brian Otis; Teresa G Bushman; Shirley A Hudler; Lisa Best; Pam Becton; Tricia Spence; Mark Castiglione; Don Rollins; Bradford Larson; George Weissman; John Grass; Gary Bryan; Melissa Graves; Charles H Otto; Chris Germany; Lia Halstead; Walt D Hamilton; Craig A Fox; Shirley A Hudler Subject: St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO] St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT]. On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt [operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there is not much negotiating that will be done. Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been such an issue. Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%, producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12% shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO. St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if 100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas. St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me know ASAP. George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR. Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT? Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the time period that processing is mandatory. Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas? Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does go into effect on Monday. Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately. joan ***********",0

"Kim, Stacy (Dickson) Granmayeh has reviewed the proposed Master Contract that you drafted for enovate, L.L.C. and I have likewise reviewed the proposed Master Contract that you forwarded to Enron North America Corp. As I indicated earlier, these contracts are similar to the contract we started with last year in documenting the transaction that was ultimately entered into.  I recall providing a copy of our Sample Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement together with the credit departments requirements which they required in order to enter into the transaction.  I am told that those credit requirements relating to triggering events and collateral threshold will also be necessary before Enron North America Corp. can enter into a transaction this year. Unless I specifically state that a comment relates to enovate or to Enron, these comments relate to both entities. 1. The correct name for enovate is:  enovate, L.L.C. 2. Change the Confirming Party in Section 3.12 to Seller. 3. Section 4.1 needs to be altered in such a way to make the verbal agreement of the Parties binding at the time of the phone call.  As written, any agreement between the Parties is not binding until a Transaction Confirmation is executed by both Parties. 4. The word ""Contract"" in Section 5.1.1.b. should be changed to ""Transaction"". 5. The concept of ""Point(s) of Receipt"" and ""Point(s) of Sale"" need to be collapsed into Point(s) of Delivery at which point title and possession is transferred from the Seller to the Buyer. No need for two separate concepts. 6. Delete Sections 6.5 and 6.6 in their entireties. 7. Alter Section 8.3.3 concerning Locked Prices in such a way to make the Locked Prices binding at the time of the phone call; not upon the passage of 48 hours for receipt of confirmation. 8. The term ""Commodity Charge Index Adjustment"" used in Section 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 needs to be defined. 9. The first sentence of Section 10.3 should be altered to delete the last phrase &of the negligence of the other Party8 and include the following phrase in its place:  &the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the other Party.8 10. Delete the phrase &(not via facsimile)8 from the first sentence of Section 12.1. 11. Add the following phrase at the end of Section 15.3: &; the loss of Buyer,s Markets; or Buyer,s inability economically to use or resell gas purchased hereunder.8 12. Delete the phrase &or Buyer or Seller claims force majeure for a period exceeding seven (7) cumulative days or five (5) consecutive days during the Transaction Term8 in Section 16.1.b. 13. Add the following sentence to the end of Section 16.1.e:  &Party fails to perform any covenant set forth in this Contract.8 14. Delete the third sentence of Section 16.2 in its entirety. 15. Delete Section 16.3.d in its entirety. 16. The Corporate Guarantee in Section 19 should be a payment guarantee not a performance guarantee. 17. With regard to enovate, change &Wisconsin8 to &Illinois8 in Section 21.5; and with regard to Enron, change ""Wisconsin"" to ""Texas"" in Section 21.5. 18. Section 21.7 requires &mutual execution of an appropriate supplemental written Transaction Confirmation8 for an effective modification.  This conflicts with Section 8.3.3, which does not require execution of a Transaction Confirmation for a Locked Price. 19. Delete Section 22.e in its entirety. 20. In Exhibit A, delete Section 12, Regulatory Contingency, in its entirety. Please review the foregoing and provide revised contracts to both enovate and Enron for further review in accordance with the foregoing matters. ***********",0

According to a source close to AEKI, the government has not contacted the association at all. Another possible sore point is the interest rates charged by the banks for coffee retention. So far there has been no indication that favorable interest rates will be extended to AEKI. Some are concerned that the rate will be higher than that charged by the private banks. Due to the tension which exists on these issues, AEKI has threatened the government that if the money is not chanelled before April they will release 10,500 tons of coffee in their retained stock from the warehouses in Lampung and Medan. There are people who believe that 10,500 tons is ""just the tip of the iceberg."" There is more than 7,500 tons in stock in Lampung alone, according to an important domestic farmer in Lampung,  who is close to our source. In fact the farmer estimates that Lampung itself has more than 10,000 tons and there are another 4,000 to 5,000 tons in Medan. VIETNAM COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- VIETNAMESE DUMPING ""PHANTOM STOCKS"" IN NEIGHBORING MARKETS Our primary source comments that in his opinion, it may be true that there are additional stocks over the 150,000 tons as reported. Cambodia has been used as a dumping ground for Vietnam's extra quota sales. Upon investigation, our source learned that it is true that there are some excess stocks stored in Vietnam. He was informed by a source that the Vietnamese plan to release the stocks into Cambodia and also China to sponge up the excess supplies. They command a fixed price in the black markets of those countries and provide much needed foreign exchange to the Vietnam government. The secondary source said that this is common practice for Vietnam and they have done this for other cash commodities like Cashewnuts. The source does not know the exact figures, but estimates the excess to be 30,000 to 40,000 tons more than what has been acknowledged by the government. ***********",0

"thanks for the update.  I also need the adgas contract.  I have the oman contract and the vessel (mitsui charter)  any other contracts you can provide is crucial, and I'd like to get them monday.  Thanks.   Jeff Clay Harris@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 01/06/2001 12:14 AM To: Jeffrey A Shankman@ECT, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Daniel R Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Dabhol Jeff/Mike, I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers. From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer.

However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versus the rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coast trading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec 2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango for the remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anything demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higher of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is still plenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and see game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated it's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology. SPOT TRADES 150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo basis 6000 kcal/kg 160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg 150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at $30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg. 2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively. Strike price  is $40.50 basis Amsterdam/ Rotterdam and expiry is Feb 15 and Aug 15. Premium - $0.50 cents. SELLING SIDE British Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to current contract we have with them which runs out end March. Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR deal and sell incremental cape for March arrival. H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA. Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 Fob South Africa. NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising EOL in the next week to hedge some of their implied short position. Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for November delivery at $47.50. Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen supplying them some 850,000mt of generic quality coal on an annual basis. Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on delivered stockpile basis ENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob ARA. Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into Nordenham at $43.75 cif. Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge. BUYING SIDE Duiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to get back to us within the next few days. Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - thanks!! Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian mkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business going forward. Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fob Maputo level. Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for 2001. Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for 2001 Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart. We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backend of the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell into the mkt. EOL Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point. Details of operational functionality are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckons it will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as competition, if successful it could provide us with more access to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers. Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros and after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL. GAMEPLAN We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between $30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South African material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases - our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mkt in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond. While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.

Looks like the Conventional Steam Boilers used by producers in the field (average boiler: 50 Million Btu/hr, uses 1400 mmbtu/day of gas) that have been shut-in, use approx.. 100,000- 150,000 mmbtu/day of gas  (mainly, Texaco, Chevron, and independents).  This number can vary depending on which majors have firm transport on the pipelines and don't have to pay spot SOCAL Border prices.  This steam generation is used in either Steam Floods or Cyclic Steam Operations. 2. Crude production has probably not been affected, but if the injections stay down, you could see production start to fall off in 3 or 4 months. Crude prices in California are very weak right now (Kern River diffs are $10-13 under WTI when they normal run in the $5.80/$6.10 area).  Majors that have downstream facilities have outlets for their crude and probably have no plans to cut production.  Independents are seeing weakness on the buying side for the West Coast Independents and majors that normally buy their crude.  It might be 2-3 months before things clean up a bit out there on the crude side. 3. Gas injection-  The question here is due producers decide to risk the integrity of their reservoir's by reducing pressure and not injecting the gas.  This probably would only be done for a month or two.  Noone wants to damage any of their wells.  This volume is not well known, but in the overall picture really shouldn't affect prices that significantly.  Usually this gas is pretty sour and does not command a high price.  This would also be the cheapest source or gas for producers to use (if they bought any make-up gas for their process). 4. Referring to the question #2, the majority of EOR methods used in California are Steam Floods and Cyclic Steam Processes.  The oil is very heavy and needs HEAT in order to recover it out of the ground.  Just injecting gas would not accomplish this.  There are a lot of CO-GEN units that generate steam for most of the Majors and these are not being shut-in or slowed down.  Only sustain high gas prices for 6 months would probably start affecting Crude production.  Let's remember that in 1998-9 crude prices were extremely low and normal gas prices didn't change what most producers did, because if they shut-in too many wells, the production would never come back. If you have anymore questions, please let me know.   Thanks Mark Anthony Sexton 12/20/2000 12:22 PM To: john.romero@mms.gov cc: Russell Dyk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kenneth Shulklapper/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mog Heu/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Smith/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: PADD V-California Gas Injection Hello, John. Again, thanks for your cooperation. Summary: A West gas trader received news from Seneca Resources stating that California crude producers that use natural gas injection (or gas lifting?) for secondary and tertiary recovery methods may stop injection and - instead - sell the gas into the market to benefit from the record high natgas prices. That being so, one wonders how much natural gas will be put back into the market and how California crude yields will be affected. Here are some specific questions that may help us: How often is natural gas used in California to enhance crude production (including gas injection/lifting, steam injection, and hot water injection)? Is this really a significant issue? What is the law concerning onshore gas injection?  If the gas was bought (not produced) by the crude producer, is the crude producer obligated to recover the injected gas?  If yes, must 100% of the gas be proven to be recoverable? On average, how much natgas volume is injected in an oil field to recover production? What is an approximate number of producing oil fields in California and/or PADD 5 What is the average size of these crude reservoirs? How many of these fields use natgas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) - reiterating question #1? Is there a unit estimate of approximately how many MMBtus/Mcfs of natgas is needed to produce 1 barrel of crude onshore? How would stopping gas injection/lifting affect crude supply in California? Would crude wells be shut-in?  If so, how would that affect future efforts to produce from them? Will a significant amount of crude be held from the market - especially in the PADD 5/Western region? What commodities are substitutes for natgas in secondary/tertiary EOR and how liquid are they in the West?  How feasible, expeditious, and economical is it for any producing oil field to use another substance for EOR? John, I really appreciate your willingness to help unearth this information. The priority on this matter is urgent, so we would be extra grateful for a prompt response.  Please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-6304, Russell Dyk at 713-853-7332, or Ken Shulklapper at 713-853-7009 for any further questions or comments. Sincerely, Anthony ***********",0

I have told her in the past that the quarterly production numbers that we provide are for internal use only, but it sounds like some of the information is going outside of Enron.  Let me know what you think.

I think they have real potential to be very valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is from Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years and who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major tenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he has done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how much comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also wholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see prices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production numbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the historical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes in production have been. The info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do not share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that we can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading strategies Unfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY but I am working on it.  I am sure a lot of this info is up there.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and discusses: what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely based, or was it vice versa), and compliance issues. A few of points I found particularly interesting: * The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems to be setting the pace, at least for the moment. * We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to cover this in EPSA. * The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact situations arise. * The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to immediately address any failures. I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to distribute it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

"Are we still on for lunch Wed.? (1) The PSEG tolling agreement is super high priority right now, b/c of mkt volatility, so I'm marking up the Black Hills deal (lots of it is not relevant or helpful b/c there are dispatch blocks in the PSEG deal, which need to be addressed somehow) and will speak to you tomorrow, I hope , after meeting w/ the commercial guys again. (2) New deal from Woody -- Wisvest is trying to unload the SOS load they have for Connecticut Light & Power -- wholesale contract, about 11% of the CT SOS load and Dana is interested in doing this one.  Wisvest wants an MOU by next week.  Just got the CA this evening and am working on it so we can get the info needed for evaluation. (3) TEPAC is still pretty hot, b/c TVA's short power, so this would be a good time to have a deal w/ them.  I still need to meet w/ everybody and go over the remaining risks on that one (4) Reliant - Dave Fairley wants to do a 50 MW deal w/ them in FL just like the one we did w/ Reedy Creek, w/ a few wrinkles I haven't fully learned about yet, except that they own 2 units and about 50 MW from another unit; he's not sure who the interconnects are with; Reliant has no native load, of course, so the FM issues will be different.  Another one that has to close very soon b/c the price is only $26. (5) E Trans is at it again, but all they need at the moment is a couple more confidentiality agreements so they can start talking to some new players. Apparently, the National Grid is interested in operating an RTO and PJM is forming its own jv to provide services to RTOs and they all want us to have some kind of role -- getting interesting again.

The reforms took effect late last month after the  legislation was squeezed through Congress and signed by  outgoing President Clinton. One start-up company, Massachusetts-based OnExchange, says  it was the first exchange to be registered under the new  legislation, having applied to the regulatory Commodity  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) several months before. OnExchange will start by trading futures on financial  markets, but also plans to act as a clearinghouse for  energy transactions. True Quote, an electronic energy  exchange, has also received CFTC clarification of its status under the new rules. The legislation comes at the end of a two-year drive to  reform derivatives markets. But this long and twisted  process is not quite over: The CFTC has withdrawn its own  set of similar reforms in order to bring them into full compliance with the new law. The CFTC reforms had been due  to take effect in mid-February; the agency said they will  be revised ""promptly."" The legislation, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act,  was pushed through Congress as part of an appropriations  bill, and signed into law Dec. 21. It loosens the rules for  futures exchanges, gives OTC contracts greater legal standing, and encourages the development of electronic  trading platforms. As a result, energy traders should enjoy a greater choice  of products and venues, while new exchanges will face lower  barriers of entry and less regulation. But the changes also  point to a more complex energy market, in the near term at  least, as well as greater challenges for price discovery. The CFTC's revised proposals will include more detail, for  example, on how exactly to apply for registration. They  also will adopt the legislation's terminology, such as the  names of three new tiers of futures exchanges. A top tier, called ""designated contract markets,"" will  match current futures markets such as the New York  Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), which allow retail participation. A second rank, of ""registered derivatives transaction execution facilities,"" will be largely limited to institutional trade, and will require looser regulation.  The third tier, which escapes most regulation, will be known as ""exempt boards of trade."" Energy platforms will not qualify for this last category. The CFTC also encourages the establishment of independent clearinghouses - which act as a central counterparty to  reduce financial risk - but these must register with the  agency. The legislation encourages online activity by limiting CFTC jurisdiction over derivatives contracts for so-called  ""exempt commodities"" - essentially, energy, and metals -  when traded on electronic platforms. This clause, Section 106, applies when contracts are traded  between experienced, institutional traders. It effectively  limits oversight to requirements preventing fraud and  manipulation. Exchanges may be required to disseminate data on prices and  trading volumes, if they have a significant influence on  the wider market. The reforms cover bilaterally traded instruments, with  multilateral activities still in something of a gray area.  Basically, an electronic exchange handling multilateral  trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for  official status, if it thinks this will bring credibility  and legal standing. However, a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued. OnExchange has been classified by the CFTC as both a  designated contract market and a recognized clearing  organization. The firm specializes in technology for  trading and clearing commodity and financial derivatives.  It will start by trading futures contracts in US treasuries, but plans to expand. The firm recently agreed with another start-up,  EnergyClear, to develop electronic clearing services for  the energy industry. EnergyClear is a joint venture of the  Bank of New York and energy brokers Amerex and Prebon  Yamane. True Quote, a Kentucky-based electronic platform  specializing in physical and financial energy trade,  recently completed development of its online platform. It  is now signing up users and plans to start trading North American contracts for natural gas, electricity, and coal in the first quarter. True Quote will also activate an  agreement with Enron, connecting its system to the  EnronOnline platform. True Quote is looking to expand into European gas and power  this year. Other products under review include carbon  emissions, weather derivatives, and bandwidth. It is not  considering oil at the moment, a spokeswoman said.

"Dear Carol, I am attaching: 1. A credit worksheet prepared by John Suttle 2. A draft ISDA schedule prepared by BTM - NEW-Schedule-Enron.doc 3. A draft credit support Annex and Corp guarantee which I have done based on previous ones for IBJ which Sara Shakleton helped us on. 4. The riders to the amendments I have made to their draft schedule (2 above).  (I decided to amend in manuscript.) I have faxed my draft changes to you at fax no 713 646 3491 (EB3814) and wonder if I could get you to take a look at my draft changes with the riders and let me know if you have any comments. I also have some questions about what the bank has proposed in their draft schedule: 1. Defn of ""Threshold Amount"" - should we be agreeing to the words in parenthesis? 2. Defn of ""Termination Currency"" - we have just been using Yen - what do you think about what they have proposed? 3. Pls see part 4(c) and (d) - I am inclined not to agree to their requests for ""Office"" and ""Multibranches"".  What is Enron's position on this sort of thing? 4. Pls see Part 5 (a), (b) and (c).  Do you think we should agree to these additional provisions? 5. Part 5 (j) - I have deleted ""Sovereign Event"" from other Termination Events but what do you think about ""Impossibility"" - do we ever agree to this? 6. Part 5 (k), (l), (m) and (n). - Do you see any harm in us agreeing to these. I will be available here in our office from 9am tomorrow morning - after 6pm your time, if you wish to discuss any of this.  Thanks very much and as usual I am very appreciative of your help.

"Jae-Moo On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note: 1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your and Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since April last year (all from Hyundai Oil). 2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim & Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on which a report may be rejected. 3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval, the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval is required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals since reporting and approval may take several weeks. 4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.

The primary interest has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new products (e.g., Seoul weather). This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point, however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at the attached document. We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at 6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict, an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated. Best regards, Jae-Moo ***********",0
"Mark please see attached agreement ---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Shults/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 09:38 AM --------------------------- From: David Mims@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 09/05/2000 11:25 AM To: Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Pilot Program Subscriber Agreement Andy and Bob- Please see the attached draft of the subscriber agreement.  Legal is making some minor modifications to the agreement (typos, etc.), but I wanted you to have the opportunity to review the agreement in the meantime. You will notice that it is a binding agreement between EBS and the Counterparties.  What EBS askes the counterparties to commit is essentially that they will support the connection and router that they own in accordance with the way that we have engineered the service, and that if they make changes to their network, they will advise us so that we can evaluate the need for any modifications to the setup.  Since we are obligated to provide a minimum level of service and a redundant service to the best of our ability, we have to get some commitment from the counterparties in this regard to ensure performance.  The agreement furthermore specifies an interconnection order with facility authorization for EBS or its designate to install circuits.  The counterparty technical contact should be expecting this language. Meanwhile, we have ordered circuits as we have discussed and are moving down the list of counterparties that have indicated a desire to participate to determine customer-specific network configurations.  Felix Perez is the Network Engineer contacting the counterparties (indeed, due to his background in Houston, he knows a lot of the technical contacts!), and we also have a Sales Engineer supporting this effort.  As Felix determines the requirements, he generates configuration specifications and diagrams, if necessary, which are sent to the counterparty. Please let me know your comments on the agreement, if any. Thanks, David Mims ***********",0
"Gentlemen- Attached pleased find the revised Subscriber Agreement, with some fine adjustments in the language as we discussed last Friday. One amendment that we discussed was the removal of some of the language related to EBS equipment.  We have done this (note no mention of janitorial services), but have elected to leave the discussion of liens and insurance in the document, in the event that our third parties need to install any equipment in order to deliver the T-1 service.  If any counterparty has a specific objection to this language, we can discuss further modifications. Leaving the language intact, however, will lessen further delays should the third-party local loop providers require some assurances about their connection equipment. Please contact me if you would like to discuss, or reply to this message with your approval of the document.  Once we confirm your acceptance of the document, we will forward to the counterparties.

As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved Gaby over to support the effort. In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and purchases) remain in Argentina. I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be supported best with their respective local legal talent. Please let me know your thoughts. MFG ***********",0

"Louise, Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also, any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional 10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer. As for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see whenever it is appropriate.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they will not be able to block the move. Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. ""In the first round, Indian lenders put their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,"" said a source. The Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California. 05/15/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent. Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement said. SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are under construction. Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei 05/15/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. (ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said. At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a company official. Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business interest. Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, Enron says. Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX 05/15/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas Price Indices. NGX acquired the AECO ""C"" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter. Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, ""We believe that inclusion of data from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that ""more is better"". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline system should improve the quality of our price indices even further."" Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, ""We are very pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices."" The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable. Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while UOG owns the remaining 51%. Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put up the money itself. Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on the price of the pipeline. Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2) 2001-05-15 16:35 (New York) Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2) (Updates with closing share prices.) Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said. ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,'' U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield, Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber. The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith. Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader, agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno, Nevada. Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's collapse. ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to comment on a potential bid by Oregon. The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp, the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland General. Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about market power,'' he said. Bond Issue Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said. Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets. California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of the Portland General purchase. Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year- earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California homes for an hour. Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31 percent this year. Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9 pence to 492 ($7) in London. Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1) 2001-05-15 16:26 (New York) Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1) (Adds closing share price.) Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million ($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange. Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating gas-price indexes. Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron spokesman Eric Thode said. NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90 percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S. Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99. ***********",1

As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report. I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a counterparty with a password must ""click through"" the Agreement before commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion. We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it. It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading. Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the following brief comments on the changes I have made: 1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a designated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group undertakings.  The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the counterparty and various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that such Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these documents. I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need to list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may be some confusion here. This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities which trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on the Website. The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this but I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on the Website depending on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate this. 2. ""Services"":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not sure what this means. I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the counterparty's access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out any Transactions.  Therefore, I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to Services, it can now refer to ""access and utilization of"" the Website. 3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3 of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron generates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any electronic records of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a document being attached which explains this.  This is also acceptable. 4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA. This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living individuals, rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing appropriate wording for this, could you please let me know what information will be collected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For example, when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or can you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other information on them once they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your technical people. Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your comments. I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto you as a matter of urgency.

While a strict interpretation of the PPA may get you there (i.e., Monthly Availability = Delivered Energy / [MIN(Requested Energy,Contract Energy)]), I'm not sure how this would play out under ""force majeure"" circumstances.

As you know for the first time ever, Brazos has elected to purchase gas supplies which would have been used in our plant had we been capable. Per section 9.05(b) of the PPA, ""if the Utility requests less than the contract energy for such gas day, the Utility may elect to purchase gas supplies from the Company on such gas day under the relevant gas supply contracts less the volumes used by the Company to satisfy the Utility's generation request for such gas day"". On both the daily and monthly (Nov) nomination sheets we fill out our generation capabilities and send it to Brazos and they intern complete and send back to us. Typically in the past when we are down (other than the annual scheduled maintenance outage) Brazos always requests contract generation which effects the monthly availability calculation (PPA definition is delivered energy/requested energy). The nominations we are now getting back from Brazos is 0 requested for generation and 45,000 mmbtu for gas. It would seem to me that if  Brazos is requesting to utilize all of the gas supply and no requested generation then they can't have it both ways and our availability would not be impacted (i.e. plant availability would be 100%). This may be splitting hairs but I thought it might be worth further examination. MG ***********",0
"britt, thanks your notes below. re bug issue - noted. just one question; do you think we should notify our suppliers in view that, if there is a problem as a result of the bugs, we will have to proceed against them??? they would want to have a rep to view the testing as well, i would think. re joint testing - pls copy eric tan on what needs to be done once a decision is made on where/when the testing will be done. re freight payment - before offering to just pay the $500,000, do you think we should propose it be paid to an interest bearing escrow account pending the results of the joint testing (or whatever other ""pending"" limitation you think might help us)?? rgds From: Britt Davis@ENRON on 09/11/2000 07:26 PST To: Paul Henking/SIN/ECT@ECT cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Harry M Collins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, James P Studdert/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO Paul, Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m. Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration. It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now appears to David and me to be at a dead end. Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the ""bug"" issue that SGS in Subic Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go forward. Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already been accepted by Mitsubishi. Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case. Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said. Britt Paul Henking@ECT 11/09/2000 02:25 AM To: Britt Davis/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Harry M Collins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, James P Studdert/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO britt, thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later. firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon but did not. secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the following information: 1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the arbitrators will say, ""pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and settle the contamination claim as a separate issue"". clearly, the c/p says that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge. on the issue of the ""pre-sale"" survey, i have discussed this matter internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding. i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this change is the result of the arbitration. be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to ""bugs"". this may sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum products. it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these ""bugs"" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described ""changes"" to the product which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and change in colour). if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we should be claiming against our suppliers. this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. just something else to be considered. 2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to get me a response before the weekend. in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their lawyers should be made rgds ***********",0

Please update the section of the disclosure for which you are responsible for inclusion in the third quarter 2000 Form 10Q .  Also, please let me know if there are any new items that should be considered. Please respond no later than Monday October 30. Gary 3-6841 3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron,s financial position or its results of operations. Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the &Panhandle program,8 a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs, gas ratably with other producers, gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court,s class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs, claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE,s March 1995 general rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment in Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals. On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC,s authorization of PGE,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan. PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bill 3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciated investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC,s authority to allow PGE,s recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan. Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Court of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC,s order allowing PGE to recover a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decision accepting the Utility Reform Project,s petition for review.  The Utility Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate the new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000 elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionally, due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict, with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regarding PGE,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron,s financial position or results of operations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant and sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances were released to the environment during the period in which Enron,s predecessor owned the site, and that Enron,s predecessor assumed the liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November 1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA. Enron does not expect to incur any additional expenditures in connection with this site. Enron,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation. ***********",0
"Richard - in response to your memo dated 7/18/00: First of all I'm confused by her attorney's letter dated 6/27/00 regarding the reference of a per share prices of $8.68 and/or $4.34.  I don't have a clue where this number came from.  Nowhere in the Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) is there any reference to a ""per share"" price.  Under Sec. 2.03 all prices referenced are in millions of dollars aggregate format. Pursuant to Sec. 2 of the Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated 7/14/99 ECTMI purchased from the selling shareholders +/- 85% of the stock of Ecogas for an Initial Payment of $23.75 million.  Of this amount $3 million was withheld [pursuant to Sec. 2.03(g)] pending Ecogas' successful termination of Montauk's ""right of first offer"" on or before 12/31/99.  This milestone was NOT achieved until March 28, 2000 when a restructuring of various Ecogas/Montauk/GSF (the former jv partnership between Ecogas and Montauk) issues was completed.  Therefore, of the $24 million Initial Payment, $3 million was forfeited for Ecogas' inability to meet its obligations pursuant to the SPA. In summary, Article II, Secs. 2.03(b) and (c) of the SPA includes provisions for an Intermediate Payment and Final Payment, respectively, subject to certain milestones being met.  These milestones can be described basically as a two-part test.  The first criteria requires Ecogas to be producing and selling in excess of 27,000 MMBtu/d of natural gas (methane) and the second criteria being a requirement for Ecogas to be doing son in a profitable manner (i.e., an EBITDA test).  Both test criteria are applicable to both the Intermediate and Final payments which means the criteria would have to be satisfied on 4/14/00 and 1/14/01.  In theory, both payments and the criteria requirements are part of very complex calculations involving the translation of a number of defined terms within the SPA.  Practically speaking, they can be summarized as a) gas production and sales in excess of 27,000 MMBtu/d and b) enough positive/excess cash flow above and beyond operating expenses, G&A and CapEx to provide a minimum rate of return.  For the record, on 4/14/00 Ecogas' production and sales rate was approximately 3500-4000 MMBtu/d, significantly below the 27,000 MMBtu/d requirement and their cash flow was actually negative.  Theoretically, the criteria could still be met insofar as the Final Payment is concerned since the ""deadline"" is not until 1/14/01. The obvious issue here is their false misconception that they are due ""installment payments.""  Both the Intermediate and Final Payments referenced above are predicated upon Ecogas achieving two very specific performance-based milestones, neither of which of close to being satisfied as of 4/14/00, the Intermediate Payment date.  As I said above, the Final Payment is still outstanding but is likewise subject to Ecogas successfully achieving the same perfomance-based criteria. If they persist and want to have the actual data, I would suggest you have them contact Jerrel Branson (Barbara's former husband) and have him explain the details and/or supply the information.  His number in Jackson Hole, WY is (307)734-8664. RANDY ***********",1

"FYI.  Just so you know what we're saying in California. The attached draft answers the California Municipal Utilities Association complaint that California markets are not workably competitive and therefore FERC should establish cost-based rates.  In its complaint, CMUA argued that the market isn't workably competitive because the prices were higher this summer than in previous years even in hours where demand was no higher. Seabron's paper shows that high prices have resulted from a number of unrelated structural and market design factors and increasing attempts at regulatory intervention.  He also debunks the assertions that cost-based rates will fix the problem in California and will be easily administered by FERC.

"Thanks for bringing me up to speed. My only comment on the letter is that instead of saying that we are not ""compelled"" to accept a litigation discount, it would be more direct to say that we see no reason to take a litigation discount and further discussions premised on the risk of litigation will not be fruitful. I am not sure I fully understand some of the points in the presentation materials. If you want to discuss them, please call. (Although whether I understand them may not be the point.) >>> <Garrick.Hill@enron.com> 04/04/01 07:05PM >>> Hi Tom: You may know this already, but Angela Davis in our legal group is now handling matters pertaining to Cornhusker instead of Dan Lyons.  She asked me to update you on where we are and send along two documents that need your review prior to them being sent to Brazos. As you know, Chuck Ward and I have met w/Brazos on three occasions (twice in Waco in once by phone) since your meeting with them in Dallas on December 21.  The purpose of those meetings was to further reinforce the point made by you and Carl Tricoli that, as equity sellers, PPE/ENA values the Cleburne asset based on its future cash flow with no discount for risks associated with litigation. Five developments are of significance since the last time you and I spoke: It became apparent to us during our meeting on March 16 that Brazos may have problems funding an acquisition at any price.  Specifically, Brazos is considering a number of capital projects aimed at securing long-term power commitments to fill short positions associated with the Southern arrangement rolling off in 2003.  Based on their experience w/the Cleburne, TX facility, Brazos appears to be committed to controlling their own destiny, and might find it much easier to fund marginal projects with an all-in cost (or collateral value) that is closer to market. Primarily as a result of point 1, Brazos has asked us to look at the possibility of PPA restructuring vs. acquisition. Also in conjunction with point 1, Brazos has been working with a number of potential energy suppliers to secure long-term power commitments.  It appears to us that they are preparing to sign some form of commitment next week. Clifton Karnei sent a letter to Chuck Ward and Steve Tick on March 29 outlining expectations for a conference call that took place yesterday. The letter, which was actually received after the conference call, will be faxed to you this afternoon.  Attached is a draft response along with a presentation that outlines the manner in which the partnership could restructure the PPA.  Steve, while he has not seen the letter, is of the opinion that it's Brazos' turn to speak; we may not need the letter, but it reinforces a number of points and sets up a restructuring in such a way that we might like to send it along. We are giving a great deal of thought to the notion that a third party might be willing (and able) to pay considerably more for this asset than Brazos given its PPA, gas market conditions, and dispatch profile. Specifically: Southern (having realized the PPA has embedded in it an in-the-money call option on gas) has recently begun to ""reverse toll"" the plant by turning it back during off-peak hours when the net cost of replacement energy (i.e., the absolute price of market power less penalties paid under the PPA for heat rate degradation on energy taken from the plant plus gas market value) warrants economic dispatch. This asset commands a control premium from anyone that might be engaged (or about to engage) in a long-term, full requirements contract with Brazos. There are tax benefits associated with this asset that could be effectively monetized in a transfer of interests. Obviously, we would face the same obstacles that Tenaska faced in selling the asset. Please give me a call when you get a chance. Regards, Rick Hill (See attached file: Letter to Brazos @ 06-Apr-01.doc)(See attached file: Rest Concept @ 3-Apr-01.ppt) ***********",0
"Please provide your comments asap ----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 09:11 AM ----- ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 10/05/2000 09:33 PM To: ""'Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com'"" <Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com>, ""'msmith1@enron.com'"" <msmith1@enron.com>, ""'David_Aamodt@pgn.com'"" <David_Aamodt@pgn.com>, ""MBD"" <MDay@GMSSR.com> cc: Subject: Revised Draft Proposal to CPUC PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT Harvey Morris Esq. California Public Utilities Commission 505 Public Utilities Commission San Francisco, California   94102 Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EES""), Enron Energy Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO) and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectively sometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"") Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities' production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission""). The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from either EEMC or EESO.] GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show its current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make those available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000. Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers. FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions. GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions. For Portland General, the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000. Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market.] [Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions] TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX. EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly. The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require. Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions. FERC DOCUMENTS Request 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13, 2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself.

It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to our firm confidential information.  In particular, if Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity litigation  (including class actions, governmental investigations and the recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized expertise of Larry Engel.  The City of Palo Alto has its own generation capacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (the Northern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority of Northern California).  The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron, as I understand it.  We have specifically identified the City and County of San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining that suit. Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposed bankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?

As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from Needles by Dec. 2001. TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity. Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their primary point to Needles. The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to sell out the expansion space. I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find. If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks. ***********",1

"Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14 N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with direct access to several local distribution companies, including Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, NGPL, Northern and Vector. The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering ""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor supply access and optimize transportation value. Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at (402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com. ***********",1

This approval is based on my understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year. Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our ""standard discount language"" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any questions, call me.

"Thanks for your comments below. We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter. In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the noteholders reports were distributed. As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.

I haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of ""Price Risk Management Activities"" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the ""fair value"" of the trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence. Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like notional value and ""fair value"" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerned about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a real problem. Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues.  DF ***********",0

(East Breaks), certain currently operational and previously abandoned and retired in place wholly and jointly owned laterals, meter, field compressors and appurtenances located offshore Louisiana and Texas.  NGPL also requested that FERC declare these facilities to be nonjurisdictional upon abandonment and tranfer to Green Canyon and East Breaks.  The above data requests require your company to submit its views on the jurisdictional status of your fractional ownership interests in the facilities (of NGPL also has an interest which NGPL is requesting to abandon in the above dockets) and request that your submission include specific information regarding the current classification of the facilities for purposes of accounting and rate treatment.  I would call your attention Attachment 4 to the applications in both dockets which show the facilities in question and the related ownership interests that FERC is referring to.  For your conveniance I have attached Excel spreadsheets of Attachment 4 to both of the applications for your review.  The data requests themselves can be downloaded on CIPS in the captioned dockets (I have attached below for your convenience the data request sent to Koch as an example as the wording in these requests is identical except for the company and the addressee -- these requests are in Wordperfect format).

"First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a (slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF From:  Drew Fossum                           11/27/2000 06:01 PM To: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Dave Neubauer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kent Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON cc: Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: TW Fuel This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point ""x"", it should resell the gas at point ""x"" and not haul the gas to point ""y"" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the ""furthest upstream point"" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it. Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer ""fuel.""  It becomes line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK with you?  DF ***********",0

"Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom of this synopsis, the web site address  will direct you to the full report released today if you would like further information. EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from $2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for about half the change in energy projections. EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. ""In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases even as demand for these fuels grows."" EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last year ""due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear generation still declines as some existing plants retire."" Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

He has gained a good bit of experience on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.

"6.1 says when FG becomes aware of changes it ""shall"" (so its mandatory) inform us ""as soon as practicable"" after it becomes aware.  But then it says these are ""good faith estimates"" and are not to give rise to any liability on FG.  These two provisions seem inconsistent to me.   I think we should demand that FG pay.

Hope that Siemen's does come thru and then we can force the issue with FGH and show that they are being unreasonable in their demand on the specs we currently have.

Metals and everything was OK.  We were rerunning last night using direct injection.  Haven't seen those results yet. As to storage issue.  Yes, we have seen some correspondence from FGH saying that the cargo would not fit. Expect that it should just become an issue over demurrage liability - ours vs FGH . However, you never know with this John Russel guy - if the mkt were to fall away he could try to say he wants a different price on the balance of the cargo. Expect it to price out at close to $35/bbl.   We loaded minimum volume so a bit of a hit on frt.  As of ytdy it looked like the ullage was going to be short by 8 to 15kbbls.  If so we will be liable for demurrage.   Another point of interest on this one is in all their forecasts they show usage everyday during the week.  However, ytdy we hear from the Plant that they expect minimum usage (possibly zero) over the next two days due to religious holidays - All Saints.  If so then the we will probably go to about 30kbbls short of ullage and demmurage will increase from a possible 4 days to 8 days @ $23k/day.  Could this be construed as possible false info?

Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens. If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy. This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo ""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected (either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.

"FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few days.  This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the part I have highlighted. General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the project becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly. At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as ""fierce competition"", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol) does not help. As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ""ex EI"" stigma. Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold). In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11. The next several days are not going to be fun....

Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi. 05/17/2001 The Oil Daily (c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved. It's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8 billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). At the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of Zakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from the offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at the beginning of next year. Having been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the mandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press conference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands. Enron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure in the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will then sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total, which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its 24.5% interest. Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no shortage of interested parties. ""The whole industry wants to get involved,"" a source close to the project said. Among the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which would compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d Dubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then there are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for more than 20 years. ""I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy,"" said one analyst in the region. ""There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi."" After the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the course of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line of thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players may have more to gain and thus more to offer. The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is part of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to selling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that were never fulfilled. Ironically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks certain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial ""term sheet"" for the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the production of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North field. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005. Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is 88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co. Zadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP and 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme Petroleum Council decided against the idea.

In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG role, we should discuss ASAP. AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with Rick and Clay.

For fuel supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there should be attractive commercial returns with each project. I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria. If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly. Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.

"Jeff/Mike, I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers. From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/336-8400. Clay ***********",0
"I understand that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from Oxy on Thursday, and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting. After re-reading the Saudi proposals today, I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting.  Terry can fill you in on more details. Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of 1999.  The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas, power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis.  The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco, the Oil Ministry, Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co.  In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups, the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule. When the initiative was first announced, Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise.  At the same time, Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstream/infrastructure expertise.  Oxy approached us to form a partnership, which we did in good faith but with no written agreement.  We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy, but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU.  We have been working together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU. Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values (urgency, bottom-line focus, objective is money, not necessarily booked reserves, etc.)  Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not interested in upstream investment.  Oxy understands the recent changes in philosophy in Enron and is ok with this, but at the same time they are worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could jeopardize Oxy's competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant. Oxy maintains that throughout the process, Dr. Irani's personal friendship with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our proposals forward.  There is probably some truth to this.  However, at the same time, it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us. Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint Oxy/Enron presentations, the Saudis view us as linked together. This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani.  They are afraid that if Enron drops out (which we have the clear right to do), the Saudis may disqualify Oxy.  I believe that their fears are justified----I can't imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron. Proposed Way Forward We and Oxy have been shortlisted, along with several other oil companies for two projects: -Core Project 2, which is an E & P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near Jordan, combined with a gas/liquids processing plant, a pipeline, a potential power/water plant and a potential petrochemicals facility.  The market area on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential. -Core Project 3, which is an E & P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE border, combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi, a liquids plant, and several potential downstream facilities.  There is the potential to export this gas to the UAE/Dolphin, but it is a long shot. Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects. Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and they each have large upstream components.  The marketing network potential (both within Saudi and internationally) is huge, but the dilemma is to carve out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy. I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis that Oxy/Enron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up ""behind the veil"" such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities. I don't like this approach because the press won't see beyond the veil and will report it as Enron being a 50/50 partner in one or two $4 billion deals in Saudi. On the other hand, I want to be in these projects because the potential in Saudi is huge and the EGM spin-offs (liquids, etc.) could also be huge.  I believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxy's needs. The Saudi proposals break both Core Project 2 and Core Project 3 into two pieces: -an upstream E & P and gas processing venture, under a traditional PSC arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as operator, and -various downstream pipeline, power, water and potentially distribution companies in which Aramco will not be a participant, but that other Saudi investors may want a piece of.  These downstream ventures will buy gas from the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented. I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as partners, but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all upstream components.  Enron, on the other hand, will undertake to be the developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities, but will structure such projects as opportunities for various  Saudi investors supported by Project financing and with IPO's as soon as possible.  In structuring such projects, Enron would work with the Saudi government to develop appropriate regulatory regimes.   Enron, as developer and operator, would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the downstream ventures and success fees at financial close and/or other milestones. This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they want, while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual capital.  It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the Saudis to define the basis for a robust market-oriented system----similar to the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the Japanese government.  It would also give us an on the ground relationship with government authorities that control policies for the export and marketing of Saudi's crudes and liquids.  We could also offer to be the exporter/offtaker for any liquids produced by Oxy. Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more well thought out approach by Thursday, but I wanted to get these basic thoughts to you to give you, Terry and Rob some food for thought.

"Richard, Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of May they have declined to nominate at the NBP. From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ). We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm. Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they have not responded yet. You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help. By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if you need me for a phone call I can break away.

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron employees ""outside""of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all around.

Due to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review. As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts.

Enter the best-of-class competition by September 1 at http://www.fte-awards.com. ************ News Brief: +TXU Europe puts gas assets up for sale FT Energy's Gas Daily Europe reports that TXU Europe is putting its North Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed today that is in ""preliminary talks"" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was ""very early days"". The move follows ""a number of unsolicited expressions of interests"" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it is reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review. A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: ""The business has changed a lot in the last year."" TXU has already put up its UK generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts believe that assets no longer give ""competitive advantage"" to energy companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas and electricity. TXU's principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2% of the 83bn ft� Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft� Ravenspurn North field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft� Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft� Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and interests in pipelines. ///////////////// Market Brief    Monday August 28 Stocks  Close   Change  % Change DJIA    11,252.84       60.2    0.5 DJ 15 Util.     361.12  5.2     1.5 NASDAQ  4,070.59        27.9    0.7 S&P 500 1,514.09        7.6     0.5 Market Vols     Close   Change  % Change AMEX (000)      48,238  6,085.0         12.6 NASDAQ (000)    1,373,111       86,691.0        6.3 NYSE (000)      728,653 51,884.0        7.1 Commodities     Close   Change  % Change Crude Oil (Oct) 32.87   0.84    2.56 Heating Oil (Sep)       0.9988  0.03    2.94 Nat.

Anthony -----Original Message----- From:  Sexton, Anthony Sent: Thursday, March 01, 2001 8:28 AM To: Presas, Gracie Subject: Question about ERNIE Gracie, Does Enron have any statistics classes?  Ones more focused on basic statistics and the lingo (ex: alpha, beta, delta-gamma, Type I & II error, distributions, kurtosis, etc.) than the VaR class? I have not seen any in the class schedule.  In working with traders and studying Risk Mangement concepts, even our ""experts"" that know almost everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics!!!  This lack of knowledge basically makes my job as a Fundamentals Analyst (researching the underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing EGM/EA/EIM profits) very inefficient. If they already do not exist, I recommend that ERNIE institute two types of statistics classes (which mirror the existing Finance class selection). ""Introduction to Statistics"" (perhaps a database approach - including application to Excel?) and ""Applied Statistics"" (which would be a more advanced approach that specifies how Enron uses - or should use - statistics in risk management marketing). Please let me know what you think. Cordially, Anthony Sexton *36304 ***********",0

The students are working hard and appreciate your insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the Wharton School. Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year. I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the agreement to students understood in advance of their ""dedicated interview week"" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team. Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel should proceed.

I believe there are a number of issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a (by no means exhaustive) list:- i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist in this matter. iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our methods and systems and vice versa These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to involve me.

"Anjam and Kirstee, As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. The first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver prices, the second column is your VAR with 7/19 position and dummy gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19 position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before. I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page.

I understand you spoke in a seminar that took place on May 9/10 where it was discussed: 1) effective power price modelling; 2) applying a real option approach for the valuation of power plants. One consultant and researcher, who shares Enron's belief in open markets and competition (and therefore is helping us to open Argentine energy markets), asked me if we could send him a copy of the booklet or slides that you and other speakers presented during the seminar. If this is feasible, I would appreciate if you could send a copy of the material to me at Enron Am,rica del Sur, located at: Av.

He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain. Vince ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/24/2001 05:23 PM --------------------------- Scott Salmon@ENRON 04/24/2001 01:23 PM To: Amitava Dhar/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/Enron@EnronXGate, Ben Parsons/LON/ECT@ECT, George Albanis/LON/ECT@ECT, Tomas Valnek/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Having Iris visit London Hi Amitava, We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the ""product"" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts. I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required. Please let me know your thoughts. Cheers, Scott ***********",0

However as our product load increases this may become a factor over next few weeks. ______________ Mike, We look forward to talking with you and Vince later today! See you later, Tony ***********",0
"Jaesoo, as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please, implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves the following: 1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want to use and which Enron's curves belong to each region. 2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each region. This decision can be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might be other considerations. 3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve. Winston, can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo with clustering done by SAS? Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this?

Of particular interest to Enron may be the use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives. ˜ The energy solution provided is a versatile Excel/C/C++ environment for structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace. The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple electricity forward curves. Power demands by utility companies are balanced with power generating plants'˜production to determine the marginal price of electricity for multiple geographic regions. Inter-regional transmission constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border stations. ˜ The˜energy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regional power demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model parameters are determined from historical data. Marginal prices from different regions are used to determine border prices. This procedure is iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine the forward COB prices. ˜ I. Overview NumeriX is a leading provider of˜modular analytical toolkits and off-the-shelf applications that are used for structuring,˜pricing and˜quantifying the risk˜of any˜type of complex˜financial instrument˜or exotic derivative.˜NumeriX solutions are designed for easy integration with existing in-house or third-party trading or risk management applications. NumeriX solutions include: NumeriX Tools NumeriX FI NumeriX FX NumeriX EQ Some of the key benefits of NumeriX solutions include: Support for all asset classes Fixed Income Instruments Equity Instruments Foreign Exchange Instruments Commodity Derivatives Credit Derivatives Insurance Products Ability to value any complex˜financial instrument˜or exotic derivative Increased instrument-valuation precision Leading-edge valuation models and calibration routines Enhanced risk management solutions Stable development platform for building pricing and riskmanagement solutions˜ II. NumeriX Analytics ˜ NumeriX˜provides comprehensive solutions˜that feature advanced tree, simulation (Monte Carlo), stochastic mesh and calibration methods for the following models: One-factor models: Hull-White/Extended Vasicek Black-Karasinski Black-Derman-Toy Black-Scholes Multi-factor models: Multi-factor Hull-White Multi-factor Black-Karasinski Brace-Gatarek-Musiela/Jamshidian NumeriX provides a Monte Carlo methodology that employs leading-edge technology with the following features/benefits: Increased accuracy and faster convergence Better sampling of tail events Adaptive number generation Points do not cluster or leave voids Support for correlated sequences Generates normal and lognormal sequential processes or concurrent˜distributions with optional continuous or discrete bounds Supports public domain and NumeriX developed sequence generators III. NumeriX Tools ˜ NumeriX Tools is a suite of innovative development tools that provide speed, flexibility and ease of use for all aspects of derivatives pricing and risk management, including building new instruments and new models. A collection of object-oriented modules accessed through a well-designed interface available in C or C++, it includes core mathematical and computational functions required for complex derivatives pricing and risk management.˜ NumeriX Tools supports all financial asset classes and is designed to maximize flexibility and minimize development and computation time, each component of the NumeriX Tools integrates many cutting-edge algorithms into one intelligent, easy-to-use API. ˜ IV. NumeriX Applications ˜ NumeriX FI, designed for traders and risk managers, is a comprehensive and flexible off-the-shelf application for structuring, pricing, and quantifying the risk of any type of complex fixed-income instrument, interest-rate derivative, or exotic structure.

"Summary: Late night efforts by the California assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations.  Bankruptcy appears increasingly likely, but the dynamics of a Ch.11 proceeding remain unclear. SoCal Edison is likely to be the first in Ch.11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period.  Attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed. Bankruptcy would provide Davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the California Power Authority. 1. Legislation Passes Assembly, But Generators and Consumers Remain Unhappy The first legislation (AB 1X)  passed the California general assembly last night, but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms. Generators object to the 5.5 cent per KW/H price in the proposed long-term contract, while consumer groups such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power.  The legislation is expected to pass the Senate today and to be signed by Governor Davis as early as tonight. Press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill, which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities. 2. Financial Institutions Exposure to California Utilities Bank of America: $215 million J.P. Morgan: $202 million There is a total of $12 billion in outstanding loans, but much of this (arranged by Societe General) is to the parents National Energy Group and Edison International.  The $417 million mentioned above is the most immediate concern.  The Southern California Edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday's rating downgrade to junk status. The Fed will not be involved, except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities' loans and securities. There is no moral hazard here, because the Fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities' credits, which, by the way, they do not have the authority to do. 3. PG&E/National Energy Group- Shielding Assets Despite considerable anger at  PG&E for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt-plagued utility business, it would seem that Davis has little authority to intervene. The question of ""fraudulent conveyance"", which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing (which transfer can then be reversed by the court) would not seem to apply here, since PG&E went through a regulatory process before FERC to seek approval for the reorganization on Friday.  While courts are reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies, impaired creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding could attempt an appeal. 4. Involuntary Bankruptcy- Which Creditor Moves First? As for who is likely to move first, it is typically the smaller creditors or those who won't receive a good price on post-petition business. In this situation our source does not know who that would be, but believes it is more likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their major creditors files an involuntary petition. If Dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today, the debtor utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to, particularly since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of assets.  In bankruptcy proceedings (which is what is going on here), this sort of talk by a creditor such as Dynegy is just the usual ""polite conversational opener,"" akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about one's family's health. 5. Edison Teetering on the Brink- Moves Into 30 Day Cure Period Yesterday, Southern California Edison temporarily suspended a $230 million bond principal and interest payments as well as $151 million to suppliers of renewable power and $215 million due to the California PX.  Both utilities are under severe short-term debt pressure, but Edison is in the worst position. Edison Due Thursday: Dynegy note; Dynegy has threaten to take take Edison into bankruptcy court if they default PG&E Current available: $500M in cash and reserves Due Feb: 1st - $580M to ISO 15th - $431M to California Power Exchange Contrary to press reports and leaks from the Governor's office yesterday about political brinksmanship, Edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash. In this situation, it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements. The bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30-day cure period. After that the trustees will move on Edison, if Edison has not already filed.  They have three ways of financing power purchases going forward: 1) the state continues to buy power and sell Edison (and PG&E) power on a short-term basis under existing authority; or 2) pending the passage of today's legislation, the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long-term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority; or 3) Edison files for reorganization under Chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post-petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets, which it uses to pay for power until the PUC and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase. 6. New Hampshire Experience A Guide for Davis? Following the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes.  The prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable, passing a seven year rate hike of 7.5 percent. For Davis, a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover, if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement. ***********",1

One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and his aides want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term contracts. Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy. 1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves. But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the ""risky debt"" premium that PG&E and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to ""share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension."" 2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, as he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by establishing a medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees. In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the $50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can pay down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility. 3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political advisers have with ""non-market"" solutions to the energy crisis. Although the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a ""way to force eventual agreement, than an actual solution,"" the talk returns frequently to these non-market mechanisms. ""We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will re-take the plants and equipment and run them ourselves,"" a close political aide to Davis said. ""We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the reserved parking places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second."" ***********",1
"Vince, A quick project update. 1.   Sandeep and I spoke with  Robert Schenck in Adelaide.   He will email a Henwood proposal to us.  They already figured that we must be interested in modelling Dabhol. 2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John Lavorato.   I should probably re-run the earning volatility numbers, and update Ted Murphy as well. --Stinson ***********",0

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it. True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt laundering"" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=989601563&ei=1&en=6a900f004b3b1abf /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

"Gentlemen: We have had favorable responses regarding the use of our Volatility Reduction Method (Roger, I've attached a copy of our article in case you hadn't seen it).  However, there continued to be a quibble about how to create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process. Last week the consulting arm of a ""Big Five"" accounting firm indicated that the following method proposed by us would be acceptable.  We believe this method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest rate differences from overlapping (""rolling"") quarters. Method: 1)Calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios, using historical rates from the most recent, say, two years. (Note: no overlap).  This results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios (approximately 247 trading days per year). Example: If the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this: 19980801   6.5  6.6  6.7  .........  7.2 19980802   6.3  6.3  6.6  .........  6.9 19980803   6.6  6.8  6.9  .........  7.1 Then the change from 8/1/98 to 8/2/98 is: 6.3/6.5   6.3/6.6   6.6/6.7 .......... 6.9/7.1 And the change from 8/2/98 to 8/3/98 is: 6.6/6.3  6.8/6.3  6.9/6.6  ......... 7.1/6.9 2)Randomly select 62 of these ""ratio"" vectors (approx. 62 trading days in a quarter). 3)Multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector (ie, the 62 6mo ratios are multiplied together, the 62 1yr ratios are multiplied togeter, etc.).  The result represents a single quarterly yield curve transformation.  Apply it to ""today's"" yield curve.  The resulting yield curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates 4)Repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are generated, say 100. 5) Proceed with testing process. I would be interested in your comments.

"Doesn't change the order, but indicates potential issues on the 2003 Expansion. NGI's Daily Gas Price Index Breaking News : posted Oct 25, 11:12 AM Breathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe Certification Although FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers. ""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting. Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights. Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California."" Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said. Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets."" Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates."" This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground."" Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result. When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California."" -----Original Message----- From: 	Cantrell, Rebecca W.

To the extent (and only to the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable by another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff (another ""Qualified Party""), DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy markets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis and communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services and imbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptance of financial responsibility by DWR, to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified, any bid accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to the foregoing, DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases resulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions, to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment for such purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISO Tariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve the right to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and for any reason, including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6 order. As the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthy counterparty, the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet the requirements of FERC's April 6 Order. Accordingly, the ISO expects that suppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and related agreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.

[IMAGE] IssueAlert for  March 21, 2001 Dissension at FERC: Commission Divided On Price Caps, Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis [News item from Reuters, March 20] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackouts and price spikes. The three FERC commissioners, who regulate interstate electricity markets, testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts. Analysis: Since the start of deregulation in the early 1990s, FERC's various positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent. Despite its changing members, as a whole the five-member commission (with two positions currently open) has taken a ""hands-off"" approach to its regulatory role, preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry. In fact, Curt H,bert, appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush, told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time when FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether. However, significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January, dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker. As the federal regulatory body for the energy industry, FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country. The debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the future leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt. At the House of Representatives meeting on March 20, H,bert, a Republican, reiterated his objections to price caps. Chairman H,bert has maintained his long-standing opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do ""long-term damage."" In January, H,bert told me, ""I have seen no evidence that price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market."" Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California. Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that ""such controls are not a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West."" Rather, H,bert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying, ""Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect."" Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary ""time out"" or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize. ""The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and just and reasonable rates,"" Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also said that ""such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basis at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour."" Massey reiterated the severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power in the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and could exceed $70 billion for 2001. Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyzed and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for price controls. Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact, Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will ""discourage investment in new generation at a time when it is most needed"" and drive power producers to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. ""The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps,"" Abraham said. Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether or not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks. This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FERC over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RTO met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tighter regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utilities and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities. Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by President Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan. 20. At that time, the president did not indicate that H,bert's appointment as chair was temporary. Wood was appointed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in 1995 and played a primary role in the development of that state's restructuring plan. (Electric choice begins in Texas on June 1, 2001, with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan. 1, 2002). The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivated. There are two ""Republican"" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush. As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three members. Wood, reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor, has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time. However, the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman, forcing H,bert to step back into a role as commissioner. The report in Reuters indicated that H,bert, a friend and prot,g, of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), is personally ""fighting the planned move."" The nomination would require Senate confirmation. Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, the issue of price caps remains unresolved. The debate over price caps also has divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking, Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent what has been called ""price gouging"" on the part of  energy companies. Republicans believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration) should maintain a ""hands-off"" approach and allow the marketplace to determine prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now question whether*and not just how*deregulation of electricity markets should occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economist who helped deregulate other industries, says that electricity markets may not lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities (allowing a single regulated power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity). The movement toward re-regulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps. Yet, in any event, once again California remains the catalyst for decision-making on this issue. As rolling blackouts threaten to continue into a third day in the state, federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California, which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country. As the industry's top agency in charge of wholesale markets, FERC's ultimate position on price caps carries tremendous influence. Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership, FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will be conducted, or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this area.

"Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.  As an initial caveat, we have prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.

In addition, we have the following comments: 1.  In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.  It seems to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve the charge-back issues.  Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to address this issue in the response.  The Group may want to consider approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue. 2.  Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.  We have tried to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete relief as part of the Debtor's motion.  If the Debtor objects to the expanded relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically the subject of the motion.  We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional motion for relief. 3.  Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the appropriate counsel is listed.  I am trying to simply list the ""bankruptcy"" counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is any question relative to a party.  We have not intentionally left anybody off.  If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them to the list. If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it to the other members of group. We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.  The dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883.  The confirmation number is 5096040.

"I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs, opportunity costs and scarcity values. FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at the January 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there is consensus on this approach.  We will discuss this draft on a conference call on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).  To access the call, please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.

There would appear to be two salient points. 1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. These would be imposed using a formula based on ""margina1 heat rates"" times an index gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say this does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It was also completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices would rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism is basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacity payments. 2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these are like the UK and Australian ""vesting contracts"", but these involved significant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that all generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated). Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the market for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits from current long positions in the market. The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. The decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, making the CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could be taken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on the market are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the market would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these levels.

"I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy. The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion: 1.  Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding; 2.  Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay. 3.  Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs. In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds the total of the foregoing matters? 4.

[IMAGE] IssueAlert for  March 27, 2001 Two Coal Plants Announced In the Past Two Weeks by Bob Bellemare Vice President, Utility Services U.S. Electric Power of Point Lookout, New York, announced plans to construct a 249 megawatt (MW) coal fired power plant at Cherry Point in Whatcom County, Washington.  Just last week, Reliant Energy Seward LLC, a subsidiary of Reliant Energy, announced it is planning on constructing a 520 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) clean-coal power plant in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Analysis:  As the United States awakes from its energy policy slumber, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the days of near complete reliance on natural-gas-fired generation to meet our growing energy needs is coming to an end.  According to EIA statistics, natural gas prices have risen to historic highs with January 2001 utility deliveries exceeding $10/MMBtu, compared to 1998 and 1999 prices which floated between $2 and $3/MMBtu.  Virtually overnight, natural gas has gone from one of the least expensive generation fuels to one of the most expensive.  Since the January price spike, prices have settled back down to the $4 to $5.5 /MMBtu level for Henry Hub futures prices, but even these prices would have been considered high just twelve months ago. Coal, by comparison, is the United States most abundant fuel source, constituting 95 percent of our nation's fossil energy reserves.  Coal prices have actually dropped for utility deliveries over the past several years according to EIA statistics.  In 1994, coal prices averaged $28.03/short-ton ($1.37/MMbtu) compared to $24.68/short-ton ($1.21/MMbtu) for second quarter 2000.  Although coal generation currently represents over 51 percent of U.S. generation production, few plants have recently been built because of the environmental concerns associated with coal generation and the relatively low price for natural gas throughout the 1990s.  In 1999, U.S. coal production actually declined by 2.1 percent which was primarily attributable to a large drop in coal exports coupled by smaller than usual growth in coal consumption for power generation. But brighter days may lie ahead for the coal industry.  New, so-called ""clean-coal"" technologies are being tested and developed. In the 1970s and 80s the pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor (PFBC) was developed, removing sulfur (SO2) pollutants and limiting the formation of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutants inside the boiler.  The need for scrubbers or other post-combustion controls was eliminated by technology.  Texas New Mexico Power (TNP) constructed two 150 MW lignite-fired units that went operational in 1990 and 1991 based on the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology that Reliant is proposing for its 520 MW facility in Pennsylvania.  The TNP One power plant was, however, extremely costly to build.  Unit 1 cost $357 million ($2,380/kW) and Unit 2 cost $282.9 million ($1,886/kW) to construct. Another technology being developed is the integrated gasification-combined cycle (IGCC) technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas, cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants, then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas.  More than 99 percent of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process.  Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida, Indiana, and Nevada.  In the early 1990s, PSI Energy and Destec teamed up to construct a 262 MW IGCC generating unit at the Wabash River Project in Indiana for a total installation cost of $592 million ($2,260/kW).  In 1996, TECO completed the construction of its 250 MW IGCC generating unit at Polk Power station in Florida for a total installation cost of $508 million ($2,032/kW). Japan has also experimented with clean-coal technologies.  In 1998, Hokkaido Electric Power Co. Inc. started commercial operation of a 75 MW PFBC power plant.  Test operations are being carried out at two other plants, the 250 MW unit of Chugoku Electric Power Co. and the 350 MW unit of Kyushu Electric Power Co.  Japan is also testing a pilot scale (1 MW) molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) at a Chubu Electric Power Co. site. It is interesting to note that these advanced technologies have historically approached the installation cost of a nuclear plant, but have all the operational costs of a coal plant.  Now market conditions have changed, and despite the high capital and operating costs, clean-coal technologies can economically compete with natural-gas-fired generation, if gas prices continue to remain high.  Additionally, expectations are that the next generation of clean-coal power plants will cost significantly less than the early pioneers' cost.  The Department of Energy (DOE) for example, assumes an IGGC power plant can be built for $1,315/kW with an average heat rate of 8,470 Btu/kWh in its ""Annual Energy Outlook 2000"" report. The DOE deserves a great deal of credit for bringing clean-coal technology to the point of commercialization.  In 1984, the clean-coal experiment began in response to the U.S./Canadian transboundary problem of acid rain.  In March of 1987, President Reagan agreed to a new $5 billion public-private initiative to make clean-coal technologies a reality.  The program led to 40 projects in 18 states, including co-funding demonstration projects such as the PSI/Destec and TECO facilities.  In the mid-1980s the only options for reducing NOx pollution cost $3,000 per ton; today's low NOx burners have reduced this cost to under $200/ton.  These low NOx burners have also reduced emission levels from 700 parts per million (ppm) in the early 1970s to 100 ppm today.  Furthermore, the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process reduces more than 80% of the NOx contained in coal combustion gas. The DOE reports that 75 percent of all coal-fired capacity in this country is now outfitted with low-NOx burners.  Similarly, the cost for scrubbing technology, which removes sulfur pollutants, has been reduced 75 percent since the 1970s. The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most important technical issues for coal power plants because of its high carbon content.  The latest commercial plant has achieved a thermal efficiency of 43 percent by increasing steam temperature and pressure.  Even with these improved efficiencies, the coal power plant of the future may still be unable to achieve the substantial greenhouse gas reductions that could be necessary to address global climate change concerns.  There are other existing environmental regulations that may also limit the adoption of new coal generation.  The SIP Call rule requires 22 Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce NOx emission by a specified amount by May 2003, with much of the reductions expected to come from coal-fired power plants.  In 1997, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment estimated at $37 billion per year (particulate) and $10 billion per year (ozone) respectively.  The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules, and recently supported the EPA's right to regulate these emissions [see 3/1/01 IssueAlert at www.ConsultRCI.com].  These rules are significant since they will lead to additional NOx and SO2 emission reductions, the two precursors to fine airborne particles.  Mercury reductions are also being contemplated. In November 1999 the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for Clean Air Act violations.  In a settlement with TECO, TECO agreed to cut NOx and SO2 emissions by 85 percent by 2010 and pay a $3.5 million civil penalty. But in the end, the nation will likely turn to coal to help meet its growing energy demands.  Great strides have been made to reduce the environmental impact of this abundant fuel source.  Since 1970, the use of coal has more than doubled while emissions of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants have declined by 70 percent and 40 percent, respectively.  If we can continue to achieve even greater emission reductions, coal may well help provide the energy bridge to the future.

"Here are the answers to your questions: 1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking capability by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system. The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload withdrawal during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the contracts which is 2/29/2000. 2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.

"I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, we had to buy it back at index + $3.

"Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"". The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01. Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001. FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are in hand. Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below. We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For more information, please click below: Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a detailed sheet (eg Jan 01). Click below for more information: The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically. The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection. This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly reformatted.  Key points are: In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is listed in the Comments section As with the previous format, all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of the month. It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring process. We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

"Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk. The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected. The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00.

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to ""obscene"" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

"ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION Is there a settlement agreement here where we give up credits after 12/31 (assuming that they are minimal) in exchange for full payment through 12/31 (a lot of which I think has been paid)?

By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator is expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority to force generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market in an effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state, according to a source familiar with the issue. An official with the state's Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the details of the filing. The filing calls for FERC to set a ""just and reasonable"" rate for a large fraction of suppliers' capacity, while remaining supply would be able to earn market-based rates, according to the source. In addition, major out-of-state generators would have to enter into forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for ""a significant portion of their expected sales."" ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower wholesale energy costs. He is expected to announce how bidding into the forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs. The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing with federal regulators in the near future, sources said. In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of market power, the ISO has said in prior meetings. Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators can influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of generation ownership ""allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high demand periods."" About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in the spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO. In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to enter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the daily market price fluctuations. Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a ""key source of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,"" according to an ISO report. The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid operator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required to approve such an action. EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to Gary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board. Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news conference. ""We're trying to find out what's behind this,"" Heath told Dow Jones Newswires. ""We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It came as a surprise."" Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month. FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market this past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably competitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have blamed the ISO for this summer's power woes. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00 0307GMT Michael E.

As background, I have been at EECC since October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.

"Jenn forwarded me this, thought you might Enjoy it?! ----- Subject:     Re: MRS. RUPPERT! Greetings!  Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe.  Sitting at my desk trying to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs. Ruppert is kind of freaky too.  I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which I've become accustomed to in the last couple weeks. Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing!  Everything I could have wanted and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time.  The trip there was quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all.  we got settled into Athens around 4 p.m. Monday.  Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful view of the Acropolis.  Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are kind of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling me, I mean its a big city.  We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I try to avoid large groups of formal tours).  We took a ferry to Santorini and stayed there for 3 days.  Loved it!  We ate some faboulous restaurants on cliffs overlooking the water.  Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables, bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to absorb the rays.  Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we didn't bring swimsuits.  As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of the culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs.  Ryan surprisingly left his shorts on this time???  Loved the black beaches!  We tried to find a more private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our attempt.  We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing. We drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed in rock with a few tavernas.  so we had dinner there and watched the sunset. The most amazing seafood!  They took us in their kitchen to show us what they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's request being a geologist and all.  We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and then of course back down.  We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so hot, I did not venture in the water.  After the ride we had to get all the way back to the top so we took donkeys of course.  Quite an adventure as we were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff!  Luckily mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought). We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great people which we later went out with that night.  You all should have seen Ryan at the discos! Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini. Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and slept.  Loved this island a lot.  Not as touristy and the greeks were very pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer. All in all the wedding was fabulous.  I was very happy with the wedding festivities too.  And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast. The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the night before.  I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal! The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about everything!  Its just so overwhelming.  One of the best parts was sitting on the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and people's faces lighting up.  Knowing that all those people were there to share in our special moment was just so wonderful.  Of course I wish I could have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you.  We were so honored you all traveled so far for us! I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest I've ever been!  Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.  I hope you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves.  Everyone was surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed in you gals!  Except for Falb she always pulls through with something! Anyway, love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well! Forever Gams! >From: TFalb@aol.com >To: lauragammell@hotmail.com >Subject: MRS.

"Editorial/Opinion Making it hot for deregulation Gregory Palast The New York Times 08/29/2000 The News & Observer Raleigh, NC Final A11 (Copyright 2000) PECONIC, N.Y. -- While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, something important was being debated 100 miles to the south in San Diego, where there was a real display of populism. There politicians have enrolled 2 million citizens in a scary economic experiment. This year, San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices. When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that homeowners' bills would fall ""by at least 20 percent."" In fact, bills jumped 124 percent this August over last. Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24 other states have rushed to imitate California's lead. Actually, Californians were lucky. Every hour of every day, San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool. On the first hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to $9,999 per megawatt hour. That's about 5,000 percent more than the once- controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse. According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids. In fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day. One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to a single source, Daniel Fessler. In the early 1990s, Fessler, then president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures: the troubled England-Wales Power Pool. How strange. Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity than Americans. That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200 percent to 2,000 percent. In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years. The promise lasted several months, during which time five giant international electricity sellers - all new to California - imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain that were designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year. The deregulation bug is now winging eastward. New York City, for example, has reportedly succumbed to 43 percent increases in Con Edison bills. But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened. This month, thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott. The power companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses won't pay. Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school district and - without a hint of shame - Steve Peace, the state senator who sponsored the deregulation law. * * * The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's campaign. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace. And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas, which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of the GreenMountain, a power seller. But while Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against ""powerful forces,"" on this subject he's mum. No wonder: the Clinton-Gore administration still promotes California-style deregulation as a model for the nation. But someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it's not good news for Gore. During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group leading the anti-corporate uprising. Electricity is the first big U.S. industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules. For the first time, Americans feel the bite of real globalization, and we don't like it one bit. ***********",1

I have since learned that they expect the cost overrun to be between $500-600,000 or $320-350,000 net to our interest.  Kelley has promised orally to pay their joint interest billings promptly, and the billings are being generated every two weeks.  Two have gone out; one of which for $403,000 has already been paid by Kelley. Please let me know if there is anything further you'd like for me to do. Teresa Teresa G. Bushman Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3835A Houston, TX  77002 (713) 853-7895 fax (713) 646-3393 teresa.g.bushman@enron.com ----- Forwarded by Teresa G Bushman/HOU/ECT on 11/27/2000 01:58 PM ----- Teresa G Bushman 11/12/2000 05:00 PM To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lance Schuler-Legal/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Cypress Exploration Program--Operator/Cash Call Issue Mark: I spoke briefly to Steve Pruett this past week regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about.   As I mentioned in my voicemail to you, I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA.  I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed.  Steve was out of the office much of last week; he followed up Friday with the attached email message. As Steve mentions in his email, there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues, but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval.  I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order.   Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steve's execution.  From Steve's reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout (which had been initialled by Allen), I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well, although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen. Steve is one of the best and the brightest I've worked with at Enron.  He is extremely busy, working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E & P assets, as well as working on new deals.  I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures. I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated.  I will remind the ECR group at Monday's staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed. Where do we go from here?  Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve?  Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do. Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email.  In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals, time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs, and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre, Cypress, and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties, being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult, and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon. Teresa Teresa G. Bushman Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3835A Houston, TX  77002 (713) 853-7895 fax (713) 646-3393 teresa.g.bushman@enron.com ----- Forwarded by Teresa G Bushman/HOU/ECT on 11/10/2000 06:04 PM ----- Steve Pruett@ENRON 11/09/2000 07:18 PM To: teresa.g.bushman@enron.com cc: Subject: Kelly Farmout Agreement - Cypress Venture Teresa: Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources' (ECR) Cypress Venture.  The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible: Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil & Gas (sub of Contour Energy).  He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000. Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the prospect.  Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect. Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout. Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option. Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted.  Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement.  Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells.  Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle. Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations. Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement.  Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport (we thought).  The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen.  Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions, particularly who would operate.  ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations. With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept. 28th lease expiration.  Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded.  I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000). Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no.  I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions.  I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements.  The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered.  I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures, and a farmout with Enron's name on the line. It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review.  I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets (as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and signoff.  The compliance meeting last week underscored that point.  We had outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval. I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue. The demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss.  The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue.  Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA (to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial activity level.  We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S. Riceville prospect late next week. I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire.  I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake.  I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our direct-owned ventures.   I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian, Bonne Terre & Vastar ventures. ***********",0

"Here are some thoughts for Enron to share with at the Analyst meeting. Please let me know if you have any additions, changes, or deletions.  What I tried to put down were the key facts and positions.  If I've missed anything let me know.  This is not a great story. Jim OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E (about 800 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].  EES has natural gas customers within the territories PG&E and SoCal Gas. Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada but only have 50 MW excess). We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in California or by transmitting power into the state.  Enron sells natural gas to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements. Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load shaping, and efficiency improvements. Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&E. OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGES The current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model (for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' common costs). Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against competition.  Enron disagrees.  What it proves is that not finishing the job of creating real competition can result in problems. Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for California. In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, (2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and (3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy. In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market volatility. California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation assets or transmission facilities. California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator. KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE]. The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.  Enron believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&E's and SCE's tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.  We filed a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.  We are confident that these funds will be recovered.  [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE] ***********",1

We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference? I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

"President Clinton: Taking Action To Help California With High Electricity Prices August 23, 2000 President Clinton today directed Federal agencies to provide assistance to low income households and small businesses in Southern California. The wholesale price of electricity has risen steeply in parts of the country this summer, hitting California,s low-income households and small businesses particularly hard. California,s hot weather, its limited generation and transmission capacity, and growing demand have combined to significantly increase the price of electricity. Higher prices have been passed on to retail consumers, including low-income households and small businesses, in certain parts of California where the retail price of electricity is unregulated because of requirements established by the state,s electricity restructuring legislation. Earlier this week, the California Public Utilities Commission took steps to ease the burden on these consumers by adopting a plan to stabilize their electricity bills. PRESIDENT CLINTON TODAY ANNOUNCED SEVERAL STEPS TO HELP CALIFORNIA RESPOND TO HIGH ELECTRICITY PRICES: £ Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today requested that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expedite its national investigation of the operation of bulk power markets so that state and Federal regulators and policymakers can have the information they need to protect consumers in a timely fashion. £ President Clinton today directed the Department of Health and Human Services to release $2.6 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) emergency funds for low-income households in Southern California. This release doubles the funds that the affected region in Southern California currently receives under the LIHEAP program, helping low-income Californians who have faced substantially higher electricity rates this summer. £ President Clinton also directed the Small Business Administration to urge its lending partners in Southern California to use SBA credit programs, particularly the 7(a) program, and technical assistance to help small businesses in San Diego and Orange Counties hurt by high electricity prices. SBA,s existing range of loan programs is flexible enough to help businesses whose costs have increased because of high electricity bills. PRESIDENT CLINTON ONCE AGAIN CALLED ON CONGRESS TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRICITY RESTRUCTURING LEGISLATION: The President urged Congress to work with the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies to enact comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation, which can promote greater investment in generation and transmission facilities and enhance regional planning, reliability and the efficiency of the interstate transmission grid, each of which is needed to ensure the availability of affordable and environmentally responsible electricity to power America into the 21st century. TODAY,S ACTION BUILDS ON EFFORTS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS MONTH TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS ELECTRICITY NEEDS THIS SUMMER. Earlier this month, in order to help reduce the risk of power outages as a result of electricity shortages in California, the President directed that managers of all Federal buildings in California take steps to reduce consumption of power to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the health and welfare of employees, and that Federal agencies coordinate with other state and local government agencies to minimize the use of electricity in all government buildings in California. President Clinton also directed earlier this month that all federal agencies take steps to help California maximize available electricity. The Federal government is one of the largest electricity consumers in California representing approximately 2% of all electricity use. ***********",1

Two other recently introduced new bills are equally disturbing and counter-productive:  AB60X (Hertzerg) would make plant certification contingent upon the developer agreeing to sell the power to the state at ""just and reasonable, cost based rates.""  SB39X (Spier) would classify power plant as public utilities and would dictate plant operations to a very significant degree. The proposals are significantly outside the mainstream and offer a political, as opposed to an economic, commercial, financial, or technical solution. Around the rest of the world, governments are privatizing these industries, relying on efficient capital markets to provide both the infrastructure  and the products and services that derive from that infrastructure. Astonishingly, California is moving in the opposite direction, toward a state-owned and operated, centrally-planned industry. The notion that a state takeover of the industry is the only choice that California has left is false, will lead to a seriously flawed economic policy, and will result in consumers paying higher prices for lower quality services for years to come. As a political solution, these bills will not increase supply, decrease demand, or get the utilities back on their financial feet. In fact, they are likely to do just the opposite: They will result in a significant expansion of the state bureaucracy and create additional burdens on the state budget. The transmission buyout contemplated in SB33X is extremely complex, requiring buy-in from state and federal authorities, bondholders, creditors and others. California will be forced to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to achieve the deal, with no certainty of success, particularly in view of PG&E's public opposition. There is no evidence that the State has any expertise in overseeing a TX system as large and complex as the ones possessed by PG&E and Edison, even if it did manage to complete the transaction. Nor have any estimates been made regarding how much additional capital California will be required to invest in what is generally viewed as a transmission network in desperate need of repair and upgrading. In the meantime, summer approaches, and the gap between supply and demand remains staggering. This complex, costly and litigious alternative will in no way reduce the serious threat of blackouts that California faces this summer. When those blackouts arrive*and they will unless bold action is taken swiftly* consumer will wonder why policy makers spent their time negotiating the price of utility transmission assets. As important, it is extremely difficult to see how the transmission buy-out offers creditors a better alternative to bankruptcy court. Indeed, when viewed against the uncertainty of achieving the transmission buy-out, particularly in light of the politically charged atmosphere in which the debate is taking place, creditors seem increasingly inclined to opt for the relative certainty that comes with a bankruptcy court. If that happens, the State loses a significant amount of influence over the situation. Moreover, SB6X squarely inserts the State into the power plant business, despite the face that there is abundant private capital ready and willing to invest in California*IF California provides the investment environment to attract that capital. Unfortunately, these bills create an environment that is hostile toward investment capital. Distressingly, the state could finance, develop, own and/or operate power plants, at the same time that it controls the monopoly transmission system. In addition, any company that uses the newly-created &Power Authority,s8 financing authority would have the price that it can charge for power set by the &Authority,8 or, if the developer is a utility, by the California PUC. In sum, the biggest player in the power business*the State*will control the network that power suppliers must use to get their power to market. The state will control the price to use the network, and in many cases it will also control the prices power suppliers charge for power services. This scenario makes the old vertically-integrated monopoly structure look inviting. Capital markets will run from this &solution8 and put capital to more productive uses outside of California. Under this proposed &solution8 only IOUs and municipal utilities will build plants, and the state will be forced to finance them. That,s the same recipe for inefficiency and waste that got California to electricity prices that were 50% higher than the national average. We,ve been down that route; it,s been given chance after chance to succeed, and it,s failed.  State-ownership and intrusive regulation haven,t worked in the past, and they won,t work today. This package of bills will increase the risk of blackouts this summer; increase the time it takes to close the gap between supply and demand in California; increase the likelihood of bankruptcy; and force businesses to look elsewhere to locate and/or expand operations, all of which put California,s economy at risk. The real solution is to succeed in doing what California failed to do the first time*lay the groundwork for truly competitive retail and wholesale markets and foster an environment designed to foster investment, invest, rather than chase it away. ***********",1

These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration of Schedule F loss repayment include: o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP losses on their energy schedules. o Payment of third party impacts due to ""through flowing"" Schedule F transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be included in the LRP. o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset of a schedule. o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.

"Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like. Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff. Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of wisdom.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term fixed contracts. IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the Press Conference. We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

Rock did call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked him to run it again and it seemed to be OK. With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes. I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in a row in quick succcession. I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been able to load these into the test data bases. The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any time to convert these spreadsheets over. The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based directory will give much better response.

With the volume being well over 50 deals per day with Koch, they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end, as they are doing all of the work related to Confirmations (Comparing details to their system and return faxing).  Now, Koch would like to go to both Counterparties sending confirms, comparing each other's paper to the system and notifying only in the case of discrepancies.  I suggested to Koch that we might try using a system similar to Sempra's in which we send our Confirms and they return a one-page fax which lists our deal numbers and their agreement or disagreement with those deals.  Still, they considered this to be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any discrepancies.  I'm sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon, so I wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it comes to that. Thanks, Joe ***********",0

I do have a few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks. The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed. Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion. He came across as very sincere---indicated that they were working ""around the clock"" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He asked for FERC to help get Califonia to ""stabilization"" and specifically asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California. He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak. Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion. Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear) Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  ""why should Montana ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants.""

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC Commissioner). Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that FERC do ""its part"" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets. Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison. Overall, the ""no price cap"" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be under considerable pressure to give in to caps). The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the letter. Best, Jeff ***********",1

"*  from Associated Press (4/9/01) * discusses rates and blackout potential for each state * Louisiana on verge of power crisis, they say... * I think I might move to Nebraska! Here's an attachment for easy distribution: Here's the full article for quick scanning: Monday April 9 4:23 PM ET Power Situation by State By The Associated Press, A state-by-state look at the electric power situation for summer: Alabama: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve 15 percent above what is needed to meet peak demand. Residential and business customers will pay rates about 1.1 percent above a year ago. Alaska: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely. Hydroelectric power is plentiful, and generating systems are not being taxed. Electric bills are expected to fall slightly. Arizona: There is little likelihood of a power interruption. Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand, and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates. Arkansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely. Electric bills are expected to rise 5 percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago, when readings topped out at 111 degrees in Little Rock. California: Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer. Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts, accelerated construction of new power plants and ``a bit of luck'' could help avoid blackouts. Grid managers have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January. Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the L.A. Department of Water and Power provides its own generation and isn't connected with the state's grid. Colorado: The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or brownouts as 93 percent of its power comes from coal-fired plants. Because of fixed, long-term contracts for coal, producers do not anticipate any fuel cost adjustments. Connecticut: No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated. Brownouts are possible, though, if there is a prolonged spike in usage while power plants are down. Utilities are under a mandatory price rate cap. Delaware: Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or brownouts, but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver it. Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are concerned over the possibility of increased costs. However, under a 1998 deregulation law, the cost of electricity is temporarily capped. Florida: Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has reserves of about 20 percent. Utility companies have already increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs. Unless coal and oil wholesale prices increase sharply, consumers should not expect major rate increases. Georgia: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state because a for-profit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive to build more generating plants. Rising costs for natural gas, which fuels almost all new electric plants, could increase residential electric bills by 25 percent. Hawaii: There is little likelihood of blackouts, rolling brownouts or price spikes. As an island state, Hawaii's electricity system is not connected with that of other states. Each island has its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand. Idaho: There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts but bills are rising. The state's largest utility wants a 34 percent increase in residential rates. Illinois: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as generating has been increased with a number of small ``peaker'' plants. Homeowners shouldn't see a rate increase, either; electricity rates are locked in through 2004 under the state's deregulation plan. Indiana: There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops operating. Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy surpluses, which have decreased from 30 percent to 10 percent over the past decade. Iowa: While the state does not expect blackouts this summer, problems could occur as early as 2002 with serious capacity problems by 2006. Only single-digit price increases are expected this summer. Kansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely. Kansas has never had a regional transmission blackout. The size of electric bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers use for air conditioning. State law prohibits price spikes by regulated utilities, which supply 70 percent of residential customers. Kentucky: Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in the nation, but will likely rise between 3.2 percent and 3.8 percent by 2003, largely due to pollution control equipment upgrades. There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts this summer. Louisiana: No blackouts are expected this summer but utility officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless more plants are built. Consumer advocates say bills are likely to increase by as much as 30 percent with very high natural gas prices and a hot summer in the forecast. Maine: Five new natural gas-fired power plants are on line or coming on line soon, reducing the prospect of any rolling blackouts. No consumer rate increases are expected. Maryland: The Public Service Commission does not expect any service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise. An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced, and then froze, rates for homes and businesses. Massachusetts: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past 18 months - enough supply to outpace demand surges. Residents will likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter, including as much as 42 percent for some consumers. Michigan: Under a state law signed last year that will deregulate the electricity industry in 2002, utilities cut rates by 5 percent and must cap those rates for five years. Although demand for electricity is growing between 2 percent and 3 percent annually, utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand. Minnesota: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure. Electricity costs are expected to remain steady. Many customers, however, will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and electricity bills from the long, cold winter. Mississippi: Blackouts this summer are unlikely. The two main power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are available. Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be 3 percent to 6 percent higher this summer. Entergy, another supplier, has not filed its summer rate plan yet. Missouri: Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and supply contracts, so service interruptions aren't expected. The state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are bringing new or expanded generating plants on line. State law bars rate spikes by PSC-regulated utilities, so customer bills shouldn't reflect higher generating costs. Montana: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected. Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July 2002. Flathead Electric's rates rose 29 percent on April 1 and an additional 60 percent increase is possible this fall. The two companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana. Nebraska: No rolling blackouts are expected. Electric bills are not expected to increase since the state's largest utility already increased its rates by 2 percent to 4 percent. Nevada: Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling brownouts, but monthly electricity bills for two power companies will go up 1 percent to 2 percent a month through September, based on already-authorized incremental rate increases. State lawmakers, reacting to California's energy crisis, are processing measures that would block deregulation from taking effect. Gov. Kenny Guinn also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under 1997 and 1999 laws unless he's confident consumers won't be harmed. New Hampshire: Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to conserve power on very hot days. As part of deregulation, rates will drop about 12 percent for customers of the state's largest electric utility. But rates could rise 20 percent to 30 percent for customers of the second-largest utility. New Jersey: Blackouts are unlikely because of protections included in a 2-year-old energy deregulation law. Rates are capped until 2003. However, regulators allowed utilities to raise natural gas rates over the summer, 2 percent a month through July, to make up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices. New Mexico: Most of the state will escape power outages and rate increases during the summer months. New York: To head off potential power shortfalls in New York City, the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish construction of 11 small natural gas turbines. Upstate New York's largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and brownouts during the summer. Rates are regulated across much of the state, but in New York City customers pay market prices. North Carolina: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected. No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large, regulated utilities. North Dakota: The state exports about 70 percent of the electricity produced from seven coal-fired power plants and is facing no power shortages this summer. Electricity bills to power air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter. Ohio: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless there is a long heat wave. Prices for residential customers will remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan that took effect Jan. 1. Oklahoma: There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts between May and September, but Oklahoma Gas & Electric, which has 700,000 customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas, expects electricity bills to be 10 percent to 15 percent above last summer. Oregon: Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer. The measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help salmon. Price spikes could occur. Pennsylvania: No blackouts or brownouts are expected. The state is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet demand. Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power companies agreed to cap their rates, in come cases through 2010. Rhode Island: Blackouts are unlikely, partly because of power plants built in New England in recent years. Businesses could see electric rates rise as much as 46 percent. South Carolina: With reserves of about 15 percent, there is very little chance of power interruption in the state. Two major utilities have obtained rate increases of about 3 percent to reflect higher fuel costs. Increased demand from summer air conditioning normally pushes summer bills up 50 percent by July. South Dakota: The majority of power comes from dams or coal-fired generating plants rather than natural gas. There is little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should remain stable. Tennessee: Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last raised in 1997 and should remain steady through the summer. No blackouts or brownouts are expected. Texas: Additional transmission lines should reduce the likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts. Certain fuel surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher electricity bills. Utah: Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to avoid blackouts or brownouts. Utah power has received a 9.4 percent interim rate increase and has 19 percent rate increase awaiting approval. Vermont: Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low. Much of Vermont's electricity is imported from Quebec, though the state is also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England. Electric rates are regulated. Virginia: Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of an increase in the generating capacity of the state's largest utility. The size of electric bills will be determined by the weather and consumption, not any change in rates, which are capped through 2007. Washington: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely, although utilities will have a razor-thin power margin that would not withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line. Electricity largely comes from dams, and a severe drought is reducing the water supply and raising prices. Industrial and residential customers of public utility districts have already seen rate increases. Rates could rise 10 percent to 20 percent this year. West Virginia: Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak air conditioning needs. None of the four major utilities has requested a rate increase. Wisconsin: Electric bills could run as much as 10 percent higher this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for natural gas, which fuels many plants. State officials ordered utilities in December to increase their reserves from 15 percent to 18 percent to bolster reliability during the summer. Wyoming: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could experience shortages. Xcel Energy, serving Cheyenne, has applied for a 57 percent price increase. Similar filings are expected from other suppliers. ***********",1

We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the shares in a Cayman entity. I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those certificates to Enron South America LLC, the sole shareholder of EBPH XII. The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US tax treatment.   Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock, using the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good indicator of the fair market value.  For tax purposes, we will assume the value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a narrow band on either side of that value.    If the first 1.25M certificate is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC, we will need to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the distribution.. If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis, EBPHXII will recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the distribution was made to Enron South America LLC. This would result in reporting a tax expense in 2000 and perhaps book income in 2001 if that sale takes place after the end of the year. If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less than the historical tax basis, the distribution to Enron South America LLC will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII. If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies, the same valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on the sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated.  Distributing the shares to Enron South America LLC will be much easier.

I understand that by sometime early next week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron vault. Here is what we now need to do: 1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it into three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately 1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares. 2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital split?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week. 3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision (supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would happen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about 15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email). 4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need to put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we will bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week). 5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for every small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these 1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets (execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 months time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche. Robert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M ""unrestriction"" with BONY and Skadden. Regards,  Bruce 713-853-0950 ***********",0

"Executive Summary £ Davis struggles to find Senate support for SoCal transmission deal £ Only chance of deal going through is a one-time quick vote; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die £ If not transmission deal, legislators will seize assets and seek price caps £ Asset seizure would target power contracts, then power plants; as a result the endless court battles will ensue, but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers £ Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario, with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended £ Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration Transmission Deal and Democratic Support As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed. transmission proposal, one thing is evident; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate, the less likely it is to pass.  In fact, politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate.  In the eyes of many Democratic legislators (and all Republicans) forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines; that is why the Governor's senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick ""up or down"" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week.  The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate, however, if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support, it will be pushed through.  Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as ""negotiated"" by Davis' team, the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote.  If this unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis, the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily (keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys).  According to sources, the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov. Davis and SCE. However, the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes that at least 6 Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans.  The more that bill gets picked apart in public, the uglier it looks and the more Democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it. Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state.  Among other things, the state is overpaying by about $1.5 billion for the transmission lines.  Additionally, the MOU Davis has with SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point for point, the deal Davis condemned with PG&E. Asset Seizures Since before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated Democrats.  Davis' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by, whom Davis's calls, ""profiteering power brokers"".  Of course, everyone in the Governor's office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitutional, legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the seizing would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by press conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one senior Democratic legislator, there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase. Of course, taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants.  The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark-ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot-market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof. Price Caps One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senior White House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors. ""If they had signed that price cap appeal,"" the administration source said, ""we would already have price caps. So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to listen.""  Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West. Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a long way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh. Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently ,in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permit grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing ""whatever price the market will bear"".  In other words, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC. Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield ""market power"" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companies come close. In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, that decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants. Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a decade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid $7 billion for electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $70 billion this year -- ten times the rate two years ago. Then, of course, they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way, and, well, who can blame the Democrats for saying there is a simple solution, but the White House won't allow it. National level Democrats realize California,s power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its free-market advocate, FERC Chairman Hebert, over their resistance to summer price caps.  As California,s leaders calculate this year's taxpayer energy bill at potentially $60 billion, a rogue's gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message: ""the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in Washington DC, at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees.""  And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus, the solutions articulated by California's Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less ""free market"" focused.  The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps. ***********",1

"I spoke with WHP management yesterday and we are still supporting the Comprehensive Settlement - of course.  We have not reserved any time on Tuesday to speak, though.  There is a possibility that could change at the last minute, but as some of you might know, WHP is currently negotiating the sale of its California assets.  Things are in limbo to say the least.  It would be a short, terse message from WHP, if any. I think Mike's suggestion that some of the details have another look should focus towards the Interim Settlement, or more specifically the PD provisions, as opposed to anything in the CS.  Even though we can all express our support of the CS, it is not being voted on, and there is no alternate decision that would even allow that for now.  But as Mike suggests, maybe the Commission can be persuaded that the status quo needs to change in light of today's environment; which means the PD has to be changed.

"Leslie et al. Joe Hartsoe asked me to review this.  Please include me on future distributions re: CA gas issues. My suggestion is to weave in some ""facts"" on why prices are where they are. The easiest and most defensible way to do this would be to insert quotes from the CEC's recent analysis.  Although the CEC is certainly not beyond reproach, it generally has been pretty evenkeeled on fuels matters.  CEC states that fundamentals--i.e., high EG demand (due to demand growth and reduced hydro), and a lack of take away capacity--is the cause of high prices and (by implication) NOT due to capacity release.  They also make statements that these fundamentals are working themselves out: increased drilling, new interstate capacity, and (assuming CPUC support) increased intrastate capacity.

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity .

"Tim always tells me EPMI's biggest problem about accessing transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information.  Tim wants all ISO information - as he says ""more, better, faster.""  In other words he wants: meter and outage information, water levels, bids and schedules, actual flows, transmission availability and congestion. Making this information available is necessary for three reasons.  This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market.  It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market.  It would also, as Sue points out, remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders. Susan J Mara@EES 09/08/2000 12:06 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@ENRON cc: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES, Mona L Petrochko/SFO/EES@EES, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT@ENRON, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS OK.  I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free to comment as well. The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to the traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.  Now, they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over. We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15. So, what are the access issues? Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.  Has been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the estimated coast was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify building the line then. PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes. There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret PG&E's contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how it's some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like interruptible -- but once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed the issue.  Also, Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on Path 15.  Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated. Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in transmission (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then changes prices, and then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has promised to do better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes yet. Advantageous access. Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific, rather than owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item. Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation.  The ""sanctity of contracts"" under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get to do it every half hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary services, etc.) There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight on. The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the ""new"" transmission charge for CA -- into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO.  The munis want huge handouts to join. And part of the ""new"" T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis -- I've pointed out that this amounts to the IOU's customers paying for the munis' stranded transmission costs, when they are already paying for the IOUs' stranded generation costs, but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO. It's really not our issue, but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state.

We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control ""path 15""?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and are there links between these ""preferences"" and the current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us. ***********",1

For the time being, we are going to work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on.. Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 /Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the following structure: Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during the term of the agreement. Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the agreement. Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot prices. Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06. One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I thought about two options: Dummy Option or, Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described.

First, even if the legislature doesn't do anything, the CPUC fix is already in place.  SDG&E doesn't need any statues to ""do the right thing"".  We should just leverage the CPUC. Second, it looks like the Dems and Reps are going to reach conclusion on a SDG&E bill; our language is in the mix.  Let's not be too close in case something blows up. 2. Finish the Williamson Act.  Dave Parquet says that having the fixes now is probably worth $10MM because he can flip the property this year instead of next year (need 4Q00 earnings). 3. Cut a deal with SCE / PG&E / CMA.  The big issue in California is to make money in the place where the market is the biggest.  Also, we need to protect (a) EES' book and (b) ENA's ability to buy and sell in CA without wholesale price caps (this takes no retail rate volatility).    Maybe we could get these parties to agree on some key going forward issues for the market - natural gas restructuring, wholesale market with Flowgate model, deal on key FERC Unresolved Issues, maybe something commercial with PG&E?   The deal is to have the retail rate cap extended, but not the CTC collection, until 12/31/03 with a CPUC opener to 12/31/04.  Not sure if this sales or if they'll let us in the tent, but would be interesting to discuss with Sandi. From what I can tell we seem to be preventing this bill.  Let' remember that this is just going to be an issue next Summer and so why not deal with it now. Please let me know your feedback.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to keep negotiations to a minimum. Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress. For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating. Let me know if you need anything else.

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron?

"Miguel, To further clarify the CNG settlement provision with regard to Base Gas sales please see the following. ""CNG will credit to its customers through the TCRA any net proceeds from such sales above net book value up to a cumulative level of the costs that CNG has recovered from its customers through the stranded cost surcharge under Section 18.2.A of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff.  In addition, CNG will credit to its rate base one half of any cumulative net proceeds from such sales that are in excess of the cumulative amount collected under Section 18.2.A, and CNG will retain the other half."" Section 18.2.A of CNG's tariff provides for the recovery of Stranded Costs (as a result of Order 636 or its progeny).  Examples of stranded costs that are potentially eligible for recovery under this section are storage facilities, production facilities, product extraction facilities and transmission facilities that have been rendered no longer used or useful as a result of the pipeline's compliance with Order 636. Basically, the level of gains to be retained by CNG is dependent upon the level of stranded costs (facility costs -  e.g. losses on sale of gathering facilities) incurred by CNG and collected from its customers.  It is simply a netting mechanism (losses and gains) to address customer concerns that the pipeline could potentially recover its losses on the sale of assets as stranded costs, and also retain the gains on the sale of assets, including base gas. The TCRA (Transition Cost Rate Adjustment) account is a convenient surcharge mechanism used by the pipeline to, among other things, flow-through such gains covered by the stipulation and applicable tariff provisions. Requiring clarification with CNG, the following is how I think this mechanism would work. If CNG incurred and collected cumulative stranded costs of $100 and experienced a gain of $50 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit the entire $50 to its customers through the TCRA. If the gain were $150 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit $100 to the TCRA, credit its Rate Base with $25 and retain $25. In the best case scenario (i.e. past cumulative gains are equal are greater than cumulative stranded costs) CNG would be able to keep all the cash from the future sales of base gas, but would be required to credit rate base in the amount of 50% of the gain and recognize the other 50% as extraordinary income.  While there are probably some reports CNG has filed detailing the cumulative level of stranded costs recovered under 18.2.A and the gains realized on the sale of assets offsetting such stranded costs, this would be something the regulatory folks at CNG could verify. Hope this helps.  If you further questions please let me know. ***********",0

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process. I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach. Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri. Charles X30348 ***********",0

"Thanks for the info.  While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.  All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain. I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes). Let me know if there is anything else. Jim -----Original Message----- From:	Schwarz, Angela Sent:	Wed 8/29/2001 2:02 PM To:	Steffes, James D.

There is legislation pending right now as I write this e-mail.  The outcome is uncertain.  But here is what I know and what I have been working on for BOMA. First, the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September 6th, including any DA contract signed since last January.  The PUC has threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending action on the issue by the legislature.  Even if the PUC were to act, the legislature could override their action with a statute.  But I anticipate that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September 14th. The real action is in the legislature.  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB 78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison. For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it: 1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in 6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW. 2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying! 3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif. Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but pay the exit fee to do so. 4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended. Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to 1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty, but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August 24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule described in #3 above. In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR bought since January. Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these issues? 1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17, when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market power. 2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without exit fees. 3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last few months. 4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.) 5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains to be seen. There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.  The committee is going back in at 6:30 this evening and we will see what happens.  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation.

(If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration) There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed money by PG&E.  All of them are subject to to modification as information is corrected or updated.  The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly. (If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter)  Enron will not comment on specific credit exposures.  We will not confirm or deny any such numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence.  Any number presented would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other credit offsets available under the circumstances.  Again, we are very confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

Exxon's issue is that the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to PGE. Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved: 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production. 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL. 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must pay to Teco an additional $500 per month. Solution: 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line. 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL Meter #986884. 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes. 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d. If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please let me know at X-36650. Thanks, Clem ***********",0

"The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 10/31/2000 07:24 AM ----- Rosalee Fleming 10/30/2000 06:00 PM To: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com cc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Hoecker letter ***********",1

While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the next couple of days.  Once the 6"" line has been pigged, the production flows stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for liquids fallout. ***********",0

"The following procedure will be effective tomorrow, October 25th: Bill Miller will call with a volume that he wants to bid into California for a given day. We can either: 1.  Give Bill a fixed price that is in excess of his floor price.     We can either sell this energy to Dynegy, etc. in an SC trade (locking in a guaranteed spread) , or take the expost risk ourselves, granting Bill the fixed price negotiated above. 2.  Enter into Profit sharing.   Use Bill's price as a basis and split 50-50 all profits above the basis, much like Redding and El Paso.    We can use the Redding spreadsheet as a template for this transaction. 3.  Advise Bill to take energy to PX Day of with the profit sharing proposal listed above. 4. Advise CRC to take no action,  leaving their prescheduled energy within NEVP Control (take  NEVP imbalance). Either option would begin with doing an SC trade purchase from WESCO,  CRC's supplier.     We would coordinate with Wesco and/or Bill Miller  the hours and mw's involved and submit our trades to the ISO.     The energy being sold will most likely have been prescheduled to CRC from the ISO (Wesco gen.  in SP15) .   We had been ""turning this energy around""   to point it toward the ISO in the RT.    If this remains to be the  case,  we will still have to coordinate with the ISO,  WAPA and NEVP to inform them of any interruption of prescheduled energy schedules to CRC. We have been spending alot of time on the PX Day of transactions for this customer.      This option would reduce keystrokes and calls and give us more trading opportunity with CRC. As always,  you need to have a two - way in mind for each load zone and for your entire shift. DO NOT SUPPLY CRC WITH A SETTLEMENTS SHEET UNTIL I APPROVE IT.

Note1 09:42am EST 26-Feb-01 ABN AMRO Inc. (Ford,Daniel F. 212/258-1548) CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO -- Research Notes Subject: Power Companies Mentioned: CPN, DYN#, EIX, PCG, SRE Analyst:  Daniel F. Ford, CFA  212/258-1548 Po Cheng, CFA  212/258-1709 ============================================================================== = Date:     February 26, 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - Highlights: -  On Friday (2/23), Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package. He also commented that ""good progress"" was made with Sempra Energy and ""some progress"" with PG&E Corp. -  The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edison's transmission system for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3x estimated book value) and allow for the securitization of ""a substantial portion of its undercollection"". -  In exchange, Edison would: 1) make payments of approximately $420 million to its utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison; 2) commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at cost-based rates for 10 years; 3) provide cost-based rates from native generation for another 10 years; 4) give conservation easements on 20,000 acreas of watershed lands for 99 years; and 5) drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission. -  We view this agreement as a positive development. Based on the 2.3x purchase price, the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately $0.10 lower than our worst case estimate (at 1.5x) of $1.90 . The agreement, however, is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature. -  Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include: 1) a definitive agreement with Edison; 2) deals with PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy; 3) a package that the legislature can accept (which could include concessions from generators); and 4) terms that are acceptable by the FERC. -  In our opinion, the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis. While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe, we are encouraged by the governor's recent statements, which have been more positive than negative. As such, we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PG&E Corp as well as on the generation companies: Calpine and Dynegy. Other News: In other related news, on Friday (2/23) Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March 14. Note 2 05:16pm EST 26-Feb-01 Goldman Sachs (NEWYORK) EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov Davis.PCG still negotiating.Buy EIX... Goldman, Sachs & Co. Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov Davis.PCG still negotiating.Buy EI *  On February 23, EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a 'substantial portion' of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation.  This settlement appears to be a  reasonable 'shared pain' scenario and is consistent with the 'buyout vs. bailout' structure we have been anticipating. To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature. FERC also must approve the asset sale. *  EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for $2.76 billion and transfer $420 million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent.  In return, the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its under-collected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes.  If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement, in concert with passage of ABX1-1, would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares. *  Although dependent on several factors, we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies.  We believe post-settlement EPS in 2002 will likely total at least $2.00/share, which supports a conservative valuation of $20 share (10X '02 EPS, a 20% valuation discount to the peer group). *  Also late last week, PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor, had submitted proposals, and discussions were ongoing.  With the framework already established for EIX, we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future. PCG's negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower, their under-recovered balance is higher, and the potential cash 'refund' from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger. *  PCG's transmission system has a book value of roughly $1.5 billion.  At 2.3X book value, these assets could potentially be worth $3.5 billion. Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX, we estimate PCG would refund $780 million. PCG's stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature. We believe a deal like this would support post-settlement EPS of at least $2.50/share which supports a conservative valuation of $25/share (10X '02 eps, a 20% valuation discount to the peer group). *  Because EIX has a 'deal in principle' the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential 2002 earnings power. Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIX's settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture. NOTE 3 09:17am EST 26-Feb-01 Merrill Lynch (S.Fleishman (1) 212 449-0926) EIX PCG UTILITIES-ELECTRIC:California: One Goes Forward, But Need All Three ML++ML++ML     Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research     ML++ML++ML UTILITIES - ELECTRIC California: One Goes Forward, But Need All Three Steven I. Fleishman (1) 212 449-0926 Reason for Report:  Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison; PG&E up in the air; Need all 3 utilities to move forward Investment Highlights: o    On Friday, Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International (EIX; D-2-2-9; $14.69) on a financial resuscitation plan.  The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor. o    The state will purchase Edison's transmission assets for $2.76B, or 2.3x book value.  This would help pay off some of Edison's net $4.1B of undercollections (a number agreed upon with the Gov.)  The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carved-out of Edison's rates. o    In exchange, Edison will agree to: 1) Drop the lawsuit against the PUC, 2) Invest $420M back into the utility from the parent, representing tax overcollections , and 3) Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost- based rates for the next 10 years.  Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant, currently under construction, at cost-based rates for 10 years. o    A number of uncertainties remain in Edison's deal, and it is still preliminary.  The exact terms and language will be very important, particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds.  It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal, but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings (-$0.20-$0.25/share) and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of cost-based rates. o    This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis.  However, it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals.  We believe Sempra Energy (SRE; B-2-1-7; $22.10) is relatively close, but PG&E's (PCG; D-2-2-9, $13.70) talks were flailing last week.  We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board. o    We believe PG&E is willing to work a deal within this framework. However, the simple problem is that PCG's undercollection numbers are much bigger.  At YE 2000, PCG's net undercollection was more than $5B and we believe this may have reached $7B by the end of January.  Selling the transmission for 2.3x book would provide only $3.5B, leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate component/securitization.  It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase. Despite the significant hurdles that remain, we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving.  To that end, we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts. ***********",0

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to the legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've seen in the press. Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** **************************************************** Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the state,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leaned heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse. But the state,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natural Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which it recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation. As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CPUC are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California border prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against El Paso is The Brattle Group,s study of the California market. Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle Group,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in the California market. El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a report presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up. Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Paso to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio. Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee, said he ""didn,t see any smoking gun"" in either report. ""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I,m not sure that the California legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell said. ""I believe FERC is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that,s the appropriate place."" Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It,s being pushed basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said. The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There,s a concerted effort, not just on natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the finger elsewhere for the problems that we,re having in this state and I think you,re seeing some of that with the public utilities commission."" Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies seem to have taken on a life of their own. The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading. Several parties resisted FERC,s call for market information, saying the requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting access to evidence (GD 4/23). Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC,s recent ruling on the California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation. The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to drive up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.)

"I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right there's no hope for keeping me in line!

Of course with my complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have the soft and squishy part down).

"Thanks, Mark.  So you're saying that the original investigatiion prompted by the San Diego problems last summer are the current target of this investigation?  Therefore, Norm's question during the workshop indeed has some import here, how do the various ""investigations"" and/or ""workshops"" tie together for purposes of completing the record and leading to a CPUC action? Good question, probably with no answer at this time. What do you know about the May 17 prehearing conference? -----Original Message----- From:  mbaldwin@igservice.com@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-mbaldwin+40igservice+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com] Sent: Monday, April 30, 2001 10:38 AM To: Fawcett, Jeffery Cc: Hass, Glen Subject: RE: ETS State Government Affairs Report Jeff, yes. Originally , I let Susan know about this proceeding back in December. I forwarded the entire San Diego response to the initial order back then. Essentially, on November 2, 2000 the Commission issued an Order Instituting Investigation which required Sempra, Socal and SDG&E to demonstrate that SDG&E's gas supply and transmission system is adequate to serve present and future core and ""noncore"" customers. The Commission was forced into action when San Diego curtailed service to Dynegy power plants and redefined the term ""firm service"". In San Diego's response they clearly state they no longer have adequate transmission capacity to serve 100 percent of their non core loads , including EG. The Commission's target in 00-01-022 is San Diego. On March 22, 2001 the Commission broaden the entire investigation to include PG&E and Socal. In this regard, their convenient trigger was a emergency petition by the Northern California Generation Coalition to modify the PG&E Gas Accord. You quessed it, they wanted a change to the priority rules that placed EG customers a head of all other noncore customers in the priority cue. The Commission assigned a 01-03-023 docket number. Essentially, the same sort of investigation. Hope , this helps. Give me a call , we can discuss the details if you would like.

"Good Morning, Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly. <<IPW051401.pdf>> Summary: 1. IPPs Fall 0.5%   Last week our IPP composite traded off 0.5%, outperforming both the NASDAQ (-3.8%) and the S&P 500 (-1.7%).  Mirant was the strongest performer, rising 7.8%.  AES was the weakest, falling 8.7%. 2. Investors Focus on Calif. Windfall Profits Tax Proposal   On Monday evening (5/7), the California State Senate passed windfall profits tax bill, calling for a 100% tax on power sales over $80 per Mwh.  We believe the proposal should be seen as a negotiating tactic to force generators to lower prices.  Should the bill get passed in its current form, we believe CPN, MIR and NRG's exposure is limited by their power sales contracts.  Regardless, the bill presents interesting federal/state jurisdictional issues, which could form the basis for a legal challenge. 3. AES: Time for Investors to Take ""Another Look""   On Friday, AES hosted a conference call to address investor concerns regarding Latin America.  On the call, management reaffirmed its prior guidance for 2001 of $1.75 - $1.90.    While we acknowledge the risks presented by the Brazilian situation and the potential for additional negative catalysts, in our view, given current price levels, now is an ideal time for investors to take ""another look"" at AES.  The stock is trading close to its 52 week valuation trough.  Indeed, we believe it is safe to assume that the market has already priced-in an earnings disappointment.  AES's 52 week median 2001 P/E is 27.8x.  If we regard this level as AES's normalized valuation, the market is implying that it will earn about $1.59 in 2001-16% below our base case estimate and 6% below the bottom-end of management's range of guidance.  See our FC note issued today for more details. 4. Looking Ahead: Mirant Hosting Analyst Meeting on 5/14 and 5/15   MIR will host its first major analyst seminar on May 14 and 15 in Atlanta.  We believe the meeting will be an important catalyst for the stock.  MIR is currently trading at 22.2 times our 2001 EPS estimate, representing a 17% discount to the group average.  Since the beginning of the year, earnings expectations for Mirant have increased by 73%.  We believe MIR's relative valuation discount reflects investor confusion surrounding the drivers of the recent upside as well as skepticism surrounding the sustainability of earnings growth over the next few years.  We believe management will address these issues at the analyst meeting, which should help close some of the valuation gap between MIR and its peers.

"Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give you a call to discuss further. Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday: - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.

The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are most comfortable. The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations. We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future. In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan European URS competence. Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point. Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area. Organisation After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business. Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects. Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is appointed. Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes. Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of a Position Management activity. The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in the near future. At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have.  I look forward to seeing you there. Matthew ***********",0
"Keep pushing these guys.

It sounds like they are down to 4 counterparties on their previous ""asset management"" solicitation:  Enron, Southern, Duke and Williams.  Williams is their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a  below-market fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. Although Ronnie claims everyone is ""right there together"", the small pricing difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said Jackson has  now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe. I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be in touch to try and set up a time. Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit! ***********",1

I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of you if he needs to.

We are currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms. They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for about 2-3 hours). Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows: Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood Legal:  Janice Moore Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to date.  Thanks.

This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.˜ In addition to the Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the applicable surcharges and fuel. PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of transportation capacity for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of available transportation capacity.˜ Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified package.˜ If the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such package of available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.˜ If bid rate is less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:˜ Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:˜ Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100.

In attendance are Rob and John.     Can divide the presentation up into - getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - Laine Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose Current economics. - Rick Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we send the page per topic around by this friday. I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know. Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking. Pete ***********",0

By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator is expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority to force generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market in an effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state, according to a source familiar with the issue. An official with the state's Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the details of the filing. The filing calls for FERC to set a ""just and reasonable"" rate for a large fraction of suppliers' capacity, while remaining supply would be able to earn market-based rates, according to the source. In addition, major out-of-state generators would have to enter into forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for ""a significant portion of their expected sales."" ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower wholesale energy costs. He is expected to announce how bidding into the forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs. The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing with federal regulators in the near future, sources said. In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of market power, the ISO has said in prior meetings. Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators can influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of generation ownership ""allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high demand periods."" About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in the spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO. In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to enter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the daily market price fluctuations. Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a ""key source of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000,"" according to an ISO report. The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid operator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required to approve such an action. EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to Gary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board. Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news conference. ""We're trying to find out what's behind this,"" Heath told Dow Jones Newswires. ""We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It came as a surprise."" Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month. FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market this past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably competitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have blamed the ISO for this summer's power woes. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00 0307GMT Michael E.

Bid's were in the 30's with offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the $35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid. ***********",1

"Ted informed me that Jeff Skilling and Rick Buy have agreed to a discretionary VaR allocation of $15MM effective today through December 15th (next Friday) for a total North American Natural Gas VaR of $75MM. That increases our Aggregate VaR Limit for Enron to $100MM for that same period. Please modify notification and DPR reporting accordingly. Regards, Cassandra Schultz. ***********",0
"This is the response I put together for Louise. This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time. Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic. There are two basic alternatives: If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in independence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" does this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions. Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-branded site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the question: ""What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?"" I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so this week to get feedback for finalization. If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting. Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to maintain arms-length independence. Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a combined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems and back-office services to Enron and other industry players.  I think this may be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron. Let me know your thoughts. ***********",0

"Sally I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial Support model for Enron Japan. My background: In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office (MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyson) responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. In Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsible for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management, Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries & Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT. Back Office: I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of Enron APACHI). As much as possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons for this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems. Middle Office: Mandate What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 19 this year (please find enclosed) Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck will look to establish the local risk books in Tokyo and define any system     modifications necessary given the characteristics of the Japanese electricity market.  Enron Japan will handle trade capture      and risk management while confirmations and settlements will occur in Houston under Sally Beck,s supervision.  IT support and     system modification will be overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston. Discussion -  Current & Future Situation I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Also EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we might see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have a mix of activites from Enron APACHI, Enron Global Markets, EBS and Enron Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan. To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient, independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the costs in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of being an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired to perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there is only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have done it this way. There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commodities are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details, automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation side our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to later stages. Proposed MO structure for Enron Japan A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be sourced to Enron Japan, under Enron Japan's CFO. B) Outsource programmable tasks to Sydney: - Documentation (Capture & Confirmation) - Settlement - Trade Accounting C) Risk Management in Tokyo. I look forward to hear from you.

"Ted Thanks for the note - coming from JPMorgan I understand the importance of VAR as a key control measure and I appreciate that we may all need to do further work to 'institutionalise' a VAR culture in Enron. However, in this instance, I believe the initial comment has been taken out of context. I believe there is a general communication issue here. Since inception the business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as DV01on the daily DPR. However, no-one in RAC/Commercial/Commercial Support appears to have formally equated that sensitivity to the business VAR limit during the longer than expected delay to the completion of a signed off VAR model. ( informally this is being done ) I would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for RAC to have signed off this scaling factor. Bryan Seyfield and David Wall will propose this immediately. Finally, I believe both Commercial and Commercial Support for Credit Trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for VAR reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible. I look forward to discussing this and other RAC/Commercial Support interface issues with you next week Regards Mike From:  Ted Murphy 26/06/2000 14:50 To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried cc: Rick Buy, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: VAR FOR CREDIT TRADING Please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e-mails. The privilege of using Enron's balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to. It is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating VAR in a product that has been approved for trading for several months.  It is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable. Obviously, the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible.  It lies with both commercial and commercial support management.  I know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh.  This is not the point.  This is not an isolated problem.  It is not just pertaining to Europe. Please do not feel singled out.  But the scrutiny and pressure on VAR as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace.  We can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude.  Let's knock this stuff out one at a time.

"Senate leader says re-regulation, public power should be considered By STEVE LAWRENCE Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Lawmakers should consider re-regulating electric utilities or building a publicly operated power system as ways to hold down skyrocketing electricity rates, the Senate's leader said Thursday. ""I think everything has to be on the table,"" Senate President Pro Tem John Burton told reporters. How to avoid huge spikes in electricity prices is likely to be the hottest issue facing the Legislature as it prepares for its 2001 session. Electricity bills tripled after a rate deregulation plan approved by the Legislature in 1996 kicked in this year for customers of San Diego Gas and Electric Co. California's two other huge investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., say they have suffered $5 billion to $6 billion in losses because of increases in wholesale electricity prices while they've waited for deregulation to fully affect them. They may ask the Legislature for permission to raise rates to make up for those losses if they can't get authorization from the Public Utilities Commission or the courts. Burton questioned whether the utilities have lost that much. ""I know they've got problems, but it's like the baseball teams saying they lose money,"" the San Francisco Democrat said. ""Well, they lose money cause they depreciate Alex Rodriguez's $20 million contact. They ain't losing money they are making money."" PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Burton raised some ""legitimate questions"" but he said his company's losses were real. ""The fact is we cannot continue to keep borrowing money to pay the high wholesale prices,"" Low said. ""We have filed reports at the commission each month that detail the seriousness of the situation."" Burton said the PUC needs to do an audit of utility company books. ""If they are running broke who's responsibility is it to bail them out: the state, ratepayers, share holders?"" Burton asked. ""Those are not easy questions to answer."" He said consumer advocates believe utility stock holders should eat the losses and utilities believe their customers should pay to cover them. ""Maybe it's something in between,"" Burton said. Asked if taxpayers should chip in, he said one possible way to do that and try to hold down prices would be to develop more power generation systems that would be fully or partially owned by the public. ""Public power has been around for years,"" he said. ""It has worked for years."" But Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, an association of privately owned power plant companies, said there's no need to build publicly owned facilities. ""Energy is coming to California...,"" he said, adding that there are five power plants under construction in the state now. ""Getting the market back on track will not require massive amounts of legislation."" Another option is to re-regulate utility rates, Burton said. ""I never found that was a burden on me before and I don't think it was a burden on ratepayers,"" he said. If lawmakers fail to solve the problem, consumer advocates will put a public power system initiative on the ballot that will pass overwhelmingly, Burton predicted. Spokesmen for power generators and utilities did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment. Copyright , The Sacramento Bee ***********",1
"Attached is the CAISO proposal to FERC seeking approval of its Grid Management Charge (GMC).  This charge recovers the CAISO's costs of operation.  The CAISO proposes to unbundle the GMC into three cost ""buckets,"" one of which would recover the CAISO's costs associated with Grid Operations (vs. market functions).  The Grid Operation costs total approximately $71 million or 45 percent of total CAISO costs, and would be applied to all load including QF/cogeneration load ""behind the meter.""  If the charge is not/cannot be applied directly to QFs, then it is likely to be passed through to the utilities which will then attempt to recapture the costs from QF/cogenerators. Recently, IEP distributed an email asking the membership whether anyone was sufficiently concerned regarding this policy and/or the cost impacts to fund IEP's intervention in this matter.  We noted that we had been involved over the past year attempting to negotiate a compromise with the CAISO, but to no success.  Now, the issue is squarely at FERC.  To date, IEP has not received a response to that email. At this juncture, IEP is not planning on filing a response to the CAISO's GMC filing, other than perhaps a pro forma intervention (1-2 pages) so as to remain a party to the proceeding.  An intervention such as this would not entail arguements as to why the CAISO's proposal is wrong and counterproductive.  If any IEP member is interested in funding a more active, aggressive intervention opposing the CAIOS filing, please let me know ASAP but not later than Mondag, November 20.  Interventions are due November 22.

IEP is reviewing this document and will provide further correspondence as we prepare a response. If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call. Thanks, Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499 The report can be found at: http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2000-11-20_300-00-006.PDF The Press Release: California Energy Commission Report Released Summer of 2001 Electricity Supplies Better Than Expected Sacramento -- California should have enough power to meet its electricity demand next summer, unless the State experiences extraordinarily hot Weather, according to a study released today by the Energy Commission. ""With new resources coming on-line and new conservation measures taking effect, next summer looks better than expected, if we manage our resources properly,"" said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive Director. The study, prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in September, quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected in the summer of 2001. ""We produced this analysis from the ground up,"" commented Larson. ""We looked at every power plant and source of electricity available to the State to give us a realistic appraisal of where we stand for next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak electricity demand using three temperature scenarios."" The analysis indicated that under the ""most likely"" temperature conditions, next year's electricity peak demand will be 47,266 megawatts, which reflects a reduction of 220 megawatts of demand because of new utility and state energy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add an additional 2,200 to 3,000 megawatts demand in order to provide a 7 percent margin, raising the generation needed to a minimum of 50,303 megawatts. If California experiences a warmer than normal summer, the electricity system will require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements, which raises the total to 51,882 megawatts. Under this scenario, total expected resources are 52,550 megawatts. Should the State experience extremely hot temperatures, which has a 1-in-10 year likelihood of occurring, 53,104 megawatts will be needed (50,068 megawatts of demand plus operating reserve requirements), with expected resources of 52,190 megawatts. An additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts of potential generation is currently under development and may be available for part or all of the summer. The Energy Commission's demand forecast takes into consideration expected economic conditions and household growth in the State. These two factors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak demand for electricity. The Energy Commission's staff supply outlook includes existing in-state and out-of-state generation; new power plants expected to be on-line and generating electricity by August 1, 2000; and electricity imports and exports. The supply outlook also includes new renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible by funding under AB 970, which was approved by the Governor in September, 2000. California's electricity demand is growing at 2 percent per year. To ensure that there are adequate supplies of electricity to meet future demand, it will be important to add new, efficient generation as well as to implement energy efficiency and demand reduction strategies. Since restructuring occurred in March 1998, the Energy Commission has approved six major power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of 4,708 megawatts. In addition another 15 electricity generating projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts and an estimated capital investment of more than $4 billion are being considered for licensing by the Commission. The report, Summer of 2001 Forecasted Electricity Demand and Supplies, is available on the Energy Commission's Web Site at: ***********",1
"The attached comments in FERC's rulemaking proceeding on reporting requirements for the California market are being filed today.   The comments express our opinions that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and that the markets are working as they should and responding with new pipeline proposals to address lack of capacity, (2) the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act to require information are for investigatory purposes only, not for formalized, routine reporting requirements, (3) the notice of order does not indicate how the Comission would protect the proprietary and competitively sensitive information it would collect, and (4) the requirements impose a significant and undue burden on sellers of natural gas who would have to radically alter the way they manage their business in order to provide the information in the manner proposed.

"Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 12/13/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) By Mark Golden NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said Wednesday. ""We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness,"" Kean said. ""They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government guarantee."" Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely. ""There's no point in talking about it,"" Cortright said. The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers. ""The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief,"" Cortright said. ""Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets more dire."" Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers. Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties Commission indicated that it may do so, reversing a decision made just last week. ""With new generation coming on, you would expect the rates to decline in a couple of years,"" Cortright said. The California Independent System Operator almost had to institute rolling blackouts Wednesday because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to concerns about the ISO's credit. California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of the ""dirty 13."" Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very limited amounts of power to the ISO. ""We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control only 70 megawatts of generation in the state, which we offered to the ISO today because of the emergency, but the ISO declined to purchase that power,"" Kean said. That small generating unit is located in the southern California, while the ISO's supply problems were most acute in northern California. ""We aren't selling any other power to them right now. Everything else that we bought we've sold to other buyers,"" said Kean, who added that Enron had sold to the ISO as recently as Tuesday. The ISO manages California's electricity grid and purchases last-minute additional power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities. The ISO then bills the utilities, which are PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas & Electric Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers. For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the ISO has been purchasing about one-fourth of the state's entire needs at very high prices. It's current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to $100 million. ***********",1

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market over the next two years. Immediate changes include the following: * Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). * Create congestion management design proposal. * Establish generation inter-connection procedures. * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements. FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 2002: * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction. * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price paid by all. * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ***********",1

"Attached please find an electronic file containing a memorandum to file I prepared after reviewing materials provided me by Peggy Banczak and Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and following a meeting I had in Washington, D.C. on Monday of this week with Peggy, Rogelio and Lic. Jorge Canals, an Amparo specialist who has been representing Enron's interests in the Amparo proceedings. As Joe Dilg indicated to you we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore cannot give an opinion on the likelihood that the Mexican Appeals Court will uphold the dismissal of the Enron-Vitro Amparo entered by the District Administrative Court.  Nonetheless, I thought Lics. Lopez-Velade and Canals had a very good understanding of the matter and well-reasoned views concerning the likelihood that the dismissal would be overturned on appeal. As indicated in my memorandum they consider the most likely outcome of the appeal will be confirmation by the Appeals Court of the dismissal entered at the trial court level.  I have known Lic. Lopez-Velarde for many years and consider him a competent thoughtful lawyer.  I met Lic. Canals for the first time Monday and was favorably impressed by him.  He comes highly recommended by Lic. Lopez-Velarde. The plaintiff in this matter has brought five other almost identical Amparo suits against various energy permit holders.  Four of those suits have been dismissed and their dismissals upheld on appeal.  Dismissals have also been entered by District Administrative Courts in the Enron-Vitro Amparo and the one other Amparo proceeding brought by plaintiff of which Mexican counsel is aware.  Appeals of both those dismissals are pending.  Because of the workings of the Mexican judicial system, the earlier Appeals Courts decisions upholding the dismissals entered by District Administrative Courts of the other four Amparo proceedings brought by the same entity that is the plaintiff in the Enron-Vitro Amparo proceeding have no stare decisis effect, but they do have persuasive value. I am providing your assistant a copy of this message in the event you do not have access to your E-mail.  Thank you for the opportunity to work on this matter with Peggy and your Mexican counsel.

"ISDA PRESS REPORT - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2000 * New MAS Guidelines On Credit Derivatives - Business Times (Singapore) * Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals - Australian Financial Review * Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract - Business Times (Malaysia) * CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry; How Is The Question - Bridge News * Web Bond-Trade Systems Draw Regulators' Scrutiny - The Wall Street Journal New MAS Guidelines On Credit Derivatives Business Times (Singapore) - December 1, 2000 By Ling Su Ann The Monetary Authority of Singapore yesterday issued new guidelines on the capital treatment of credit derivatives to deal with the problem of ""excessive"" capital charge for a debt asset. Credit derivatives , first used in the United States in 1991, are used by banks to reduce their risk exposure to certain credits or loans. In a typical credit-linked note transaction, the protection seller (Bank A) assumes the credit risk from the protection buyer (Bank B) in return for a stream of regular interest payments. Bank B will then assume the default risk for a pre-selected asset and Bank A will acquire the credit exposure to both the reference asset (in this case, the notes) and Bank B. Under Section 3.3.2 of MAS notice 627, the seller is required to sum up the risk-weighted exposures to both the notes and Bank B. A capital charge of 12 per cent is then applied to the aggregate credit exposure, resulting in a uniform 24 per cent capital charge for protection selling banks. This would clearly be excessive, says the MAS, especially when the reference assets are of very high credit quality. In June last year, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision proposed a more risk-sensitive standardised approach.  Pending the finalisation of this new framework, protection selling banks should not be unduly penalised, MAS said. To address this concern, protection sellers will now be allowed to apply the higher of the risk charges appropriate to the reference asset or protection buyer, subject to the condition that both are rated as being investment grade or higher (BBB-and above). Should the credit rating of either fall below investment grade, a dual capital charge must be applied to both these credit exposures. Where the reference asset or protection buyer is not rated, the MAS may waive the dual charge rule on a case-by-case basis. However, it must be shown that the risk faced by the seller is adequately addressed by a single capital charge. ""The rule won't impact Singapore banks right now because they don't enter into a high amount of credit derivatives.  But it will ... make things more transparent by telling banks how to treat the notes on their balance sheets,"" said Joe Toh, credit analyst at UOB Asia. Derivatives Platform May Give CBA Edge Over Locals Australian Financial Review - December 1, 2000 By George Lekakis Commonwealth Bank of Australia is hoping that a new inhouse derivatives risk management platform will lead to a reduction of regulatory capital it is required to hold on its balance sheet. The new risk simulation system, known as C-SPARQ, was launched in July and is being used to scope credit and market risk in CBA's institutional banking arm. Mr. Ellis Bugg, a senior risk executive, said the system would be extended to the foreign exchange operations in the next six months. He said the platform would give CBA a competitive edge over other local investment banks in evaluating current and future trading exposures. Mr. Bugg said the Reserve Bank was aware of the advantages of the inhouse system, but was not yet prepared to allow any variation in the bank's Tier One capital requirements. ""Up until now most risk analysis systems have simply analysed present positions and risk exposures,'' he said. ``This system is forward looking, allowing us to project exposures in the                   future over the entire life of a five-year contract, for instance.'' The bank is also considering setting up a special unit that would take on risk management business from corporate clients and less efficient financial institutions. The head of technology in the institutional bank, Mr. Bob Stribling, said CBA was among a handful of banks that had the capability of running near real-time credit simulation on a global basis. ``We think we have something quite special that could be used outside the group.'' A string of derivatives -driven disasters in global banks since the mid-1990s has prompted cross-border regulators, led by the Bank of International Settlements, to clamp down on the measurement and reporting of derivative risk in banking. CBA embarked on a complete overhaul of its risk management system in its investment bank in November 1998 and launched the new platform in July. At the height of the Asian economic crisis in 1997, shortcomings in the risk management systems of institutions such as ANZ and Caspian Securities were highlighted, with the companies reporting big losses from derivatives -related activities in emerging markets. Since then local regulators have paid more attention to the risk management tools and disclosure of the big four Australian banks National, CBA, Westpac and ANZ on their derivatives -based exposures. Mr. Bugg said no other bank in Australia had developed such risk management capabilities. CBA was aware of only three North American banks that were using similar methodologies. Kloffe Launches KLSE CI Options Contract Business Times (Malaysia) - December 1, 2000 By Debra Moreira The Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange Bhd (Kloffe) today launches its second product - the KLSE CI (Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index) options contract.  The move is part of the plan to increase the number of products and enhance liquidity in the market. Kloffe is hoping the product will attract local and foreign institutional support which will subsequently assist towards building and attracting liquidity. Kloffe, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the KLSE, is the first derivatives exchange in Malaysia.                    Executive chairman Ramli Ibrahim has said that the new product is a step in he right direction to woo foreign investors back in the country citing as one of the reasons investors were staying out was due to a lack of choice in products. Kloffe will also be introducing an additional two products by the first quarter of 2001, placing high importance on futures products based on Islamic index.  ""It (the options contract) is a good step forward in developing an interest and hopefully bring back the foreign investors. It is a step in the right direction,"" Ramli said. Although a huge initial demand for the product is not expected, Kloffe expects the product to grow gradually as people get used to it. ""Kloffe recognises that it is critical for all market participants to be properly educated to ensure that they have sufficient understanding of the use of derivatives products and are fully equipped to manage their investment portfolios,"" said Ramli. As such, Kloffe is currently undertaking a comprehensive marketing and educational programme for the KLSE CI Options launch and to promote the existing product.  An option provides the holder/buyer the right, without the obligation, to purchase (call) or sell (put) a quantity of a specific underlying instrument at a stipulated price within a specific period of time. To acquire this right, the holder/buyer pays a minimal price known as the option premium to the seller (also called the writer) of the option. A futures contract however, is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a specific time in the future for a specific price determined today. CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry; How Is The Question Bridge News - November 29, 2000 By Mary Haffenberg After months of anticipation, new regulatory rules were released last week that pave the way for changes in how exchanges list derivatives contracts. The proposals also open the door for new electronic trading platforms and clearing organizations to jump into the derivatives listing and clearing business. But how these rules will be interpreted without making them into law is leaving some industry players wary. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator of U.S. derivatives markets, last week approved rules first proposed in February that create a new regulatory framework for futures markets. The rules, which go into effect 60 days after they first appear in the Federal Register, create three regulatory tiers under which various futures contracts and swaps products in established markets will fall. The idea is that the three tiers will match the degree of regulation to the varying nature of the products and the customers trading in the markets. Under the new rules, the three regulatory tiers are recognized futures exchanges, derivatives transactions facilities and exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities.  Products within the RFE category, for example, will allow for retail participation and those contracts will have the most customer protection and regulatory safeguards attached to them. A bill that passed the House of Representatives in October but is stalled in the Senate would make into law most of these CFTC rule changes. The bill also would legalize single stock futures, provide legal certainty to over-the-counter markets, take the CFTC rule changes even farther in some areas and make other changes not within the power of the CFTC. If the bill, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, does overcome significant obstacles in the Senate and pass when Congress returns next month to finish up its work, the bill would supercede any CFTC rules. Because the CFTC rules don't go into effect until at least the end of January or the beginning of February (as of Wednesday, they still had not been listed on the Federal Register), lawyers and others reading the rules have been in no hurry to digest and interpret them. In addition, a lot could change if lawmakers pass the futures modernization act. WIDESPREAD PRAISE FOR RULE CHANGES To be sure, the rule changes that have been spurred on by CFTC Chairman William Rainer have received widespread praise. Market participants and established exchanges like the idea that in the less regulated markets costs to do business are expected to decrease.   Also, less regulation could lead to more flexibility in listing and trading contracts and more experimentation in the futures markets, which in recent years have been sorely lagging when compared with the growth of cash and securities markets. There also is a double-edged sword of changes. The rules make it significantly easier for a new electronic trading platform, similar to electronic communications networks popular in the equities markets, to come in and list futures contracts, taking on the established futures exchanges that for decades have had a virtual contract-listing monopoly. The rules also allow, for the first time, non-CFTC regulated organizations to clear exempt MTEF and bilateral contracts. However, these clearing groups still must be regulated under banking laws, foreign regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Established clearing organizations and futures exchanges already are expressing concern that these new expected competitors will be able to become more nimble because they should be able to operate under less regulation. The established exchanges and clearing organizations are expected to fall under the most regulated CFTC tier of regulations if they are to continue to serve retail customers.  ""If we're a provider of a broad series of markets, it's unclear as to the net savings,"" said Dennis Dutterer, interim president and CEO of the Chicago Board of Trade. By some estimates, more than 90% of futures market participants are institutional or commercial customers. With that figure in mind, ECNs could come in and list contracts under the DTF category. That would prohibit retail customer participation unless the ECN got special CFTC approval that would allow retail trading through futures commission merchants that have at least $20 million in adjusted net capital. The exchanges, which to date have had at least some retail participation in most of their contracts, would have to continue under RFE rules.  Some industry watchers suggested that some exchanges, to combat ECN competition yet retain retail customers, could list two contracts. For example, the New York Board of Trade could have an RFE sugar pit and an all-electronic DTF sugar pit. NYBOT President and CEO Mark Fichtel said his exchange was expected to request that its sugar and cocoa contracts fall under the DTF category.  ""I'm not saying this will happen, but based on what they're talking about, they have to be careful about compartmentalizing the markets,"" said Joseph Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures, one of the country's largest FCMs. ""A probable solution would be to put it on the backs of FCMs. We could become 'market makers' to give access to our retail customers, like the FX markets,"" referring to the cash foreign exchange markets in which the interbank markets commonly take the other side of a customer trade instead of routing it to outside customers. Others question whether that is the course of the futures markets as a result of the rule changes and whether it is good for the markets to have ""peripheral markets"" proliferating. However, it's still too early to determine how the traditional exchanges will list their contracts under these new rules.  Although no one is suggesting that the exchanges will close their doors to easy access for retail customers, allowing them in their markets may not be cheap.  ""I would hope that the CFTC would continue the concept of trying to ensure that our markets are competitive with competing markets when the exchanges are looking for flexibility to respond to competitive possibilities,"" Dutterer said. SWAP MARKETS CONTINUE WITH EXEMPTIONS For their part, participants in swaps are basically happy with what the CFTC has done within their limited powers with the exempt MTEF rules. For example, new entities, such as insurance companies, can participate in the swaps markets. These markets will continue to operate under an exemption of the commodities act and will continue on without legal certainty, but a spokeswoman for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said the rule changes were an improvement over current conditions. However, the ISDA is unhappy that only financial products can be included in the exempt MTEF category. The CFTC said metals and energy contracts cannot qualify for exempt MTEF, the least regulated tier, because the markets are not sufficiently deep and liquid and there are concerns related to the exhaustibility of supply and market manipulation. As a result, multilateral electronic executing trading facilities will fall under the DTF category, which has led to concerns that the regulations may stymie innovation in these markets. Once the rules do come into play, and assuming Congress does not codify them, there is still another underlying concern. Because the CFTC rules are not law, some in the industry worry how they will be interpreted in the upcoming years and under different CFTC heads. After all, the regulator has had its share of leaders with vastly different philosophies from each other. Web Bond-Trade Systems Draw Regulators' Scrutiny The Wall Street Journal - December 1, 2000 By Randall Smith and Gregory Zuckerman Antitrust regulators launched an investigation of online bond-trading and foreign-exchange systems owned by several of Wall Street's biggest securities firms to examine whether the trading platforms are used to limit competition. Several top securities firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup Inc. have received requests for information as part of the investigation, which is being conducted by the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice. The firms either had no comment or said they are cooperating. A Justice Department spokesman said the agency is ""looking at the competitive effects of certain joint ventures in the online bond-trading industry and in online foreign exchange.""  The inquiry was reported Thursday by the Bond Buyer newspaper and the Web site of Industry Standard, a magazine that covers Internet economic issues. Ralph C. Ferrara, a lawyer specializing in securities regulation at the New York law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, said the probe raises ""an interesting issue,"" because a commonly owned utility that boosts price transparency for the entire market, but simultaneously gives firms a look at each other's market strategies ""is something that is a Jekyll and a Hyde."" The requests for information, known as civil investigative demands, involve the recent formation of several online bond and foreign-exchange portals by Wall Street's biggest firms in various combinations, people familiar with the matter say. ""I think their interest is because the largest firms are involved"" together, said John Ladensack, bond chief for the Schwab Capital Markets unit of San Francisco discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corp. Schwab, which is forming its own bond-trading portal, has avoided participation in some online marketplaces ""because of the dominance of the big players,"" Mr. Ladensack said. The probe isn't the only Justice Department investigation into the inner workings of Wall Street. Another pending inquiry, disclosed in early 1999, is focusing on the prevalence of a 7% underwriting fee for initial public offerings of less than $100 million in size. Federal regulators have looked at the antitrust implications of a wide range of other Internet marketplaces, from cars to real estate to airline tickets. The American Society of Travel Agents, for example, asked the Justice Department to investigate an online service owned by several airlines, saying it would drive travel agents out of business. The Federal Trade Commission has approved a car-parts Web site set up by the Big Three auto makers. Electronic bond trading is growing, but has yet to catch on.  Such activity represents just 3% to 6% of overall bond trading, according to Tower Group, a technology-research firm, up from about 2% last year. ""It's worth investigating the area. There are questions about how these markets will turn electronic and whether these dealers will control the market place,"" says Larry Tabb, group                   director at Tower Group. ""The concern is that they see each other's bids and can artificially manipulate prices, and that they will create an electronic market that's not open to all participants, but so far it looks like they're letting others in."" Two of the best-known upstart online-bond systems sponsored by leading Wall Street firms that deal with corporate bonds are BondBook LLC and Market Axess LLC.  Another of the big online trading firms is TradeWeb LLC, owned by a group including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers Group Holdings Inc. and the Credit Suisse First Boston unit of Credit Suisse Group. TradeWeb's trading volume represents between 7% and 10% of all dealer-to-customer transactions in the U.S. Treasury market, up from 2% a year ago, according to Tower Group, although TradeWeb officials say the figure is higher. With TradeWeb's online system, investors can contact as many as five dealers at a time and send them orders to buy or sell Treasurys or government-agency securities. Investors also can compare prices from the five firms. The dealers can't see bond quotes from their rivals, according to Tom Eady, chief operating officer at TradeWeb. Mr. Eady says the firm hasn't been contacted by the Department of Justice; securities executives said the Justice probe doesn't appear to encompass Treasury bonds.

We are not (yet) working under ""umbrella"" type of agreements where Enron and the counterparty will execute a General Terms and Conditions (GTC) with several Annexes, each of them related to a specific deal.  Each contract is to be treated as one single deal. Some of the above listed deals are 1QTR commercial priorities and I need to know if you would be OK with Enron's Marketing Co (ECE) using ICC-administered or FIESP-administered (as a second alternative) arbitration under ICC Rules in S’o Paulo as the PPA's dispute resolution mechanism. Although I am schedule to meet with Tozzini, Freire this week, I doubt I will have time to get their legal opinion, discuss it internally, prepare a recommendation to Jim Derrick etc etc.  I've already talked to some of the counterparty's in-house counsellors and none of them is willing to accept offshore arbitration.  Our counterparties' position has been arbitration in Brazil under int'l rules OR local courts. Rgds, Sami ***********",0
"Mark/Peter -  Attached is the legal risk memorandum for the G6 Energy Corp. (""G6"") transaction.  I have assigned a Legal Risk Rating of 4 to this matter. I understand the desire to keep legal risk memoranda brief.  However, given the complex structure of the transaction, which as you may recall includes an equity investment, option to increase equity holding, provision of services and exclusive rights to commodity supply, my legal risk memorandum is longer than usual. The following are the principal legal risks to the contemplated transaction: Conflict of Interest - This is an issue for various reasons including the exclusive supply arrangement, ability for affiliates of ECC to compete with G6, and ECC's ability to influence the pricing of its equity option. Authority/Capacity - As ECC will have actual knowledge of G6's authority/capacity to transact, ECC may not be able to rely on all of the standard rules/defenses typically available to it in the trading context. Corporate Governance - The main issues here are: dealing with the municipal shareholders, ability (or lack thereof) for ECC to control G6, directors' liability and shareholders' liability. Standard of Care/ Services - Given the nature of certain of the services being provided, the standard of care and other protections to ECC are key. Exit Strategy - As with any equity investment, exit strategy is highly important.  This is heightened given the potential for the municipal shareholders to vote as a group and/or mismanage G6. Non-Competition - The services agreement contains a limited non-compete that binds ECC and its controlled subsidiaries. Tax - The transaction structure captures tax losses at the G6 level. The attached memorandum discusses the foregoing in greater detail and also set out the mitigants to each of the identified risks.   In most instances the mitigants should serve significantly lessen the corresponding legal risks associated with the transaction.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss this matter further.   It is my expectation that the DASH for this transaction will be circulated during the week of April 9th.

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific business needs of this company.

Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits and approvals.  They feel pretty good about our compliance with these permits/approvals.  As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.  It seems to us that a release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to ""come forward"" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release that it had no legal obligation to do so).  Sandeep's note is below. PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms. Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC personnel.  The India legal team was able to ""tie down"" many significant issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our obligations. There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you apprised as these reviews progress.

Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We have relied on these statements as being accurate. With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the plant ""permanently"" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive - you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging. Brian -----Original Message----- From: 	Schwieger, Jim Sent:	Wednesday, May 09, 2001 11:58 AM To:	Redmond, Brian Cc:	Martin, Thomas A.; Gray, Barbara; Coffey, James; Baumbach, David; Colwell, Wes; Soignet, Kenny Subject:	Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts. ***********",1

STANDARD & POOR'S RATING EVENT	CREDIT LINE BBB- or Above	Open BB+	$10,000,000 BB	$5,000,000 BB- or Below	$0 Situation 2: Without credit lines, the credit reserve for this deal would be $450,000. In addition, the most recent S&P write-up is attached below. brant Research: Return to Regular Format Summary: El Paso Electric Co. Publication Date: 01-Aug-2000 Analyst: Judith Waite, New York (1) 212-438-7677 Credit Rating: BBB-/Stable/-- Rationale Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso Electric Co. back toward investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction targets and expects debt to be about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year, cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still, the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to reflect the company,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, high fixed costs, and high rates. The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Verde nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of the utility,s power. The plant,s past operating problems and continued structural problems add some risk to the company,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customers in the generally low-income service territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear investment, helping to put El Paso Electric in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed the company to keep a $25 million rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation of generation and transmission assets, and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electric franchise. In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New Mexico and Texas, bringing them more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition comes to either state (2002), El Paso Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should allow them to retain retail customers. By that time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated transmission and distribution business and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a regulated market) will be recovered over a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the settlement agreement. In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts with the Comision Federal de Electricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacity in the summer months of 2000 and 2001, and with the Rio Grande Electric Cooperative Inc. to supply power to two Texas cities over a four-year period. Importantly, El Paso Electric also reached a settlement with the city of Las Cruces, N.M., ending a long dispute over that city,s threat to municipalize the electric distribution system. Las Cruces sales account for about 8% of total revenue. ***********",0

"As far as your email questions, my responses are following: 1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say ""no"" for Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an eligible swap participant (or ""ESP"").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say ""not ESP"" or ""not eligible swap participant"" it means they have not met the financial net worth test. 6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note. ---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/13/99 04:21 PM --------------------------- From:  Bob Shults                           10/12/99 10:15 AM To: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities Does this mean that we have 10 utilities that are approved to trade?  What are we doing with the other 30-40? ---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Shults/HOU/ECT on 10/12/99 10:14 AM --------------------------- To: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/LON/ECT@ECT, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities We have not decided ""to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions"" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken. A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

Thanks Louise Mark, On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs? ie their decision whether to trade or not.

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 1, 2000 CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930   77 Beale Street, San Francisco CA  94105 Pacific Gas and Electric Company Welcomes FERC Report San Francisco - Pacific Gas and Electric Company issued the following statement on the report issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today: ""Pacific Gas and Electric Company is pleased that FERC has used its authority to give California many of the tools we need to fix the wholesale electricity markets in this state. We agree with Chairman Hoecker and other FERC commissioners that this report is a sound beginning to the process of repairing the marketplace, but that more actions will need to be taken, at both the state and federal level, before the goal of a working, competitive energy market can be realized in California. ""The new bid framework the Commission ordered represents a creative attempt to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to evolve. Our hope is that this new framework will be successful in moderating electricity prices. ""While the report does not find evidence of market power abuse in California this summer, FERC does provide for potential refunds, should abuse be discovered, effective as of the beginning of October 2000. ""We are very pleased with the opportunity the Commission has given us to review and comment upon this report, and look forward to providing our comments on November 9, and throughout this proceeding."" The FERC action comes one day after Pacific Gas and Electric Company made an unprecedented $790 million payment to the Power Exchange for wholesale electricity costs for the single month of August 2000. ""The wholesale electric market in California is clearly broken,"" said Gordon R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. ""We cannot continue to borrow money to pay excessive wholesale power prices, which will hit our customers sooner or later. We welcome thoughtful intervention to repair the market."" # # # ***********",1
"Steve: Your angle is much better for the corporation, and a lot of the below might be ""mastering the obvious,"" but here it is. - Rob ----------------------------------------------------- The petroleum, natural gas, and electricity price situations have a different set of facts but a common demoninator--very tight infrastructure relative to energy demand.  Here is a general set of conclusions with a few ""sound bites."" * The current energy price situation is ""all about economics.""  It is economics 101--supply and demand.  Demand has been rising faster than supply with a predictable response.  This is the bad news for consumers.  The good news is that there is reason to believe that prices for oil and natural gas are at the top of their commodity price cycle.  The NYMEX futures market shows a ""backwardation curve"" for both--look in the daily Wall Street Journal in Section C under ""Futures Prices""  that usually is around page 14.  Look at the settle price for the different energy commodities and the prices after the prompt month (October) fall over the next months and years except for this winter's natural gas price. * Big oil did not suddenly get big or greedy with petroleum prices any more than ""big gas"" has with natural gas.  Many of the same players were profit-maximizing during the previous price slump. * The constraint on energy markets is not the resource base but the infrastructure to produce, refine, and transport supplies.  Infrastructure constraints have had a cumulative effect of slowing the great engine of market supply,    reflected siting issues and also low profitability (partly the result of rapid implementation of new environmental requirements). * The solution is to stop taking supply for granted and build more flexibility and incentives in the system to profitably meet ever-rising demand.  Energy investment must compete against many New Economy investment opportunities that have potentially high rates of return. Oil This is a global market so declining U.S. production is a very small part of the world supply, but the real constraint is domestic refining capacity. Since 1990, operable U.S. refineries have declined from 205 to 159 when 50 refineries closed and only 4 new refineries entered the market.  [National Petroleum Council, ""U.S. Petroleum Refining,"" June 2000, p. 23.  Other refineries have been able to expand to increase overall capacity, but capacity utilization has risen rapidly in recent years and is above 95%--a tight situation.  EPA permits to allow further expansion is a major issue to making sure that domestic infrastructure keeps up with demand (p. 27).  A number of proposed requirements to further improve the environmental quality of gasoline has raised profitability questions as well (pp. 27-30). The two actions the U.S. can take in the short run to increase crude supplies are to lift the embargo on Iraq and withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (up to 3 mmbd).  Liquidating the reserve could be part of a privatization program to get support from the free market community, and the proceeds could be used to help low income energy users this winter.  The days don't get much more ""rainy"" than now given that without price controls price and not supply is in question in an ""emergency."" A longer run approach must be to encourage domestic and international drilling to make the supply response as elastic as possible to higher prices.  Alaska activity such as drilling at the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) would be a major contribution to world supplies. On the gasoline side, much has been written about ""boutique fuels"" where certain environmental requirements are required for certain regions that makes the supply/demand balance very sensitive to interruptions (such as refinery downtime or a pipeline closure).  The key to prevent price spikes for consumers is to not let new environmental requirements outrace technology or infrastructure constraints.  This discontinuity happened earlier this summer in Chicago, for example, where gasoline prices rose well above $2 per gallon. Electricity This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued uses.  California in particular has followed a ""soft"" energy path where conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants. The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances (such as refrigerators) are using less power.  General economic growth also means many new appliances, traditional and new, are being produced and used, adding to power demand. Natural Gas Natural gas supplies (and infrastructure to some degree) must catch up to high demand after many years of slumping gas prices and reduced incentive. Over 200 Tcf of potential gas reserves is in areas that are off limits to drilling--something that should be corrected given the advances in drilling technology that make exploration and production much less invasive to surface area than ever before.  Other public policy drivers should be a continued emphasis on expedited certification for new pipelines and avoiding new short run regulatory ""fixes.""  Past this winter, however, gas prices are expected to decline, so consumers can lock in long term prices that are below current prices. Conclusion Energy supply and infrastructure have been taken for granted for too long. It was assumed that low prices would continue despite increasing disincentives to increase supply and infrastructure to meet demand.  Demand has also increased faster than thought due to economic prosperity and the ""wealth effect.""  Market forces can correct the imbalance over time without regulatory quick fixes and with reasonable incentives for industry performance. Robert L.

Lee Sachs at Treasury reported that the CFTC and SEC have been meeting over the last several weeks and ""progress is being made on Shad-Johnson"".  An agreement on Shad -Johnson is critical to moving the legislation. House staff said that the Banking Committee filed its report to the Rules Committee which allows the Rules Committee to begin considering which combination of the three versions will be sent to the full House.  ISDA, the Banking Coalition, and the Exchanges (in conjunction with Energy Group) are meeting to reconcile the differences and have met with Agriculture Committee Chairman Ewing to this end.  Chairman Ewing would like differences resolved by September 14, the Rules Committee to report HR 4541 by September 18, and have House Floor action by September 21.  Everyone agrees that the House Agriculture bill will be the basis from which Rules works.  We faired better in the House Commerce Committee on multilaterals and metals so we need to ensure that the Commerce Committee provisions are picked up by the Rules Committee.  We will meet with Rules Committee staff next week to advocate this.  Numerous staff have said that House leadership lobbying is important at this time to push this to the ""hot list"" of issues for resolution before Congress adjourns. After speaking to Senator Gramm's staff, it is clear that they are waiting on House action.  We have presented the ""all non-agriculture commodity language"" to Senator Gramm's office, which is under consideration.  I will follow up with the Democratic staff this week. What next? I recommend we send the attached letter to the House Leadership, as well Chairmen of the Rules, Ag, Commerce, and Banking under Ken Lay's signature. In addition to DC office lobby visits, we can follow up with personal contact as folks from Houston are available to come to DC. We had contemplated a senior-level Enron official phone call to Senator Gramm to spur action from his office, but this is still premature.  Senator Gramm's staff advised that this would do little to move Gramm until the House is closer to action. Please call with any questions. ***********",0

"If you  haven't seen it.  Got this from a WAPA guy through WPTF. PROPOSED ACTION STEPS AGREED TO AT DENVER EMERGENCY MEETING ON DECEMBER 20, 2000 1. Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its efforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric power market. 2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of assistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the implications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral contracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so high; who has benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has been held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual governors views on these matters. 3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated, state-by-state, voluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting no later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale to reduce or reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service commissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users for forgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the electricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will coordinate an energy conservation response by December 28. 4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague President-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western governors on this urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made. 5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early February a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action plan for the west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy, including increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy throughout the region today and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter 2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy crisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a hemispheric energy policy. ***********",1

"Class Action Lawsuits Alleging Restraint of Trade and Unfair Business Practices Filed Against SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric, And El Paso Natural Gas LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - Two related class action lawsuits have been filed in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles, against Southern California Gas Company, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, Sempra Energy (parent of the two utilities), El Paso Natural Gas Co., and other companies related to El Paso Natural Gas. The two lawsuits allege a conspiracy resulting in restraint of trade and unfair competition and unlawful business practices.  The complaints summarize the issue as follows: This action involves a massive conspiracy to eliminate competition in the newly deregulated energy industry that has resulted in endangering California's electrical system and threatening California's economy.  It is perhaps the largest gouging of energy consumers in American history. Southern California's current ""energy crisis"" is not simply the result of ever-increasing demand by a growing population for energy.  Rather, it is the direct result of a conspiracy among the natural gas industry's most powerful Southern California players to preserve and maintain the market dominance that they enjoyed for many years as monopolies subject to regulation.  When the artificial monopoly created by regulation was disassembled, those dominant companies took prompt and illegal action to ensure that they would not lose the benefits of their market power.  Their unlawful collusion has contributed significantly to the recent astronomical increases in the price of natural gas and electricity.  As a result, Southern California customers have had to pay billions of dollars extra for their natural gas and electric needs.  This lawsuit seeks to recover those damages. (Para. 1 and 2 of complaint.) ""In September of 1996, top executives of Southern California Gas Company (""SoCal Gas""), San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (""SDG&amp;E"") and El Paso Natural Gas Corporation (""EPNG"") met at the Embassy Suites Hotel, near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.  Fearing a new era of open competition and lower prices, these latter day captains of industry gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets.  At the meeting, these three companies, who together dominate the Southern California natural gas market, illegally agreed not to compete against each other in the Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets.  They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowered natural gas prices in these markets.  The conspirators sought to eliminate competition, take advantage of electric deregulation, drive up the price of natural gas, and profit from the increased prices."" (Para 4 of complaint.) One of the two lawsuits addresses the effects of the conspiracy on natural gas prices; the other deals with the effects on electricity prices. (The price of gas-fired generation establishes the price for most of the electricity used in Southern California.) Copies of the two lawsuits filed this morning are available as Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files on the web site of the law firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer at http://oslaw.com/osnews. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are available for interviews, and can also provide additional materials, including copies of the agenda prepared for the secret meeting, as well as graphics illustrating the location of natural gas pipelines that were planned, but then terminated by the defendants following the secret meeting in Phoenix.

Handler of O'Donnell &amp; Shaeffer LLP, 213-532-2000 Web site:  http://oslaw.com/osnews E SOURCE Study:  Customer-Side Electricity Demand Reduction Could Stem Rising Power Prices BOULDER, Colo., Dec. 18 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - With electricity prices rising like floodwaters in California and other states, limited generation capacity has garnered the most attention as the culprit.  Many see constructing new power plants as the sole solution for bringing prices down.  However, E SOURCE research just out of the field indicates that convincing customers to reduce their electricity demand in exchange for cash could provide tremendous price relief in open power markets.  ""Our study shows that commercial and industrial customers are very willing to reduce demand if the price is right, if mechanisms are in place for communicating those prices, and if they have a means of controlling their electric loads.  We found that larger customers could offer almost 20 percent of their load as negawatts -- temporary reductions in electricity demand,"" says E SOURCE Vice President Bill LeBlanc. Because most electricity use is considered essential and rising wholesale prices don't immediately affect end users, prices can go sky high when power supplies get tight.  But if demand dropped in response to high prices, LeBlanc contends that overall power costs would be much lower.  He explains, ""Although there's a disconnect between price and demand in the marketplace today, we've uncovered a significant subset of customers who seem ready to participate in a dynamic pricing market.  Unfortunately, most of them don't yet have the communication and control tools that would make load management possible. They also haven't been offered a pricing product they like.""  The E SOURCE research study confirms that customers want flexibility in deciding whether to participate in load reductions on a daily or even hourly basis, as just one example. So how many negawatts are available?  According to the E SOURCE national market survey, medium-to-large commercial and industrial customers could potentially reduce their demand by 18 percent if offered a market price of $1 per kWh (one of the tested price points) for reduced electricity usage.  At this price -- which, incidentally, is what Edison International CEO and President John Bryson reported that his company paid for electricity on December 12 in wholesale power markets -- about 55,000 MW could be made available across the U.S., and about 4,800 MW in California.  LeBlanc adds, ""We can't expect to capture all of this potential.  But with the right product, pricing scheme, and marketing, it would be possible to help relieve price pressure on the whole system.""  The E SOURCE study, ""Energy Pricing and Load Management:  What Do End-Users Want?"" can help energy service providers design appropriate products and identify the customer groups most likely to participate in such programs.  It's based on an extensive research with over 700 energy decision-makers across the U.S. and Canada.

"ADMINISTRATIVE EH&S Data  ) D. Willmann, David Ronkainen, and Sandra Maldonado developed charts for Mike Terraso comparing EHS performance in 1999 and 3 quarters 2000 for the Caribbean, Latin America, and Southern Cone operations.  Data gaps and reasons were identified.  Mike reviewed data with Rebecca McDonald. Enron EHS/Operations Audit - M. Terraso has met with Don Hawkins(Senior Director ETS audits) and Phil Lowry (MD ETS Operations) and Rebecca McDonald regarding the current and possible alternative approaches to the Corp portion of the Operations/EHS audit program.  Mike has developed and reviewed verbally initial suggested improvements to the current audit, action plan and implementation tracking process, including a greater corporate role. Environmental Remediation Projects - D. Willmann and Scott Watson developed summary for Mike Terraso of environmental remediation projects within Enron's international operations.  Mike reviewed information with Rebecca McDonald. Spanish Version of Enron,s Safety, Health and Environmental Guidelines ) Ramiro Garcia in conjunction with a consultant (Franco y Asociados) completed Draft of Spanish version of the Guidelines. Enron Corp. Safety Video Project Script  ) Scott Watson and Victor Colin shot video footage for general Enron office personnel orientation and contractor orientation videos on Dec. 7 & 8. CALME Puerto Rico, San Juan Gas - D. Willmann met with Bill Middleton, EECC, and then by conference call with ThermoRetec personnel to review environmental and safety aspects of the proposed conversion of the San Juan Gas facility to operate on natural gas and the remediation work that is to be completed at the San Juan Gas site. Dominican Republic,  SECLP - D. Willmann met with Jonathan Ago to review the environmental and safety perspectives of  the upcoming installation of a new boiler at the Smith / Enron facility in Dominican Republic. SOUTH AMERICA Venezuela, Ventane Visit - Henry Van and Edgar Zuleta visited Ventane facilities in Venezuela and gave workshops on EHS management system optimization. OEC / NORTH AMERICA Medical Surveillance & Wellness Program ) Scott Watson met on 12/14/00 with Dr. Holland and Mary Ann Roman De Meza to complete the Wellness section of the Medical Surveillance Program. Garden State Paper ) Scott Watson and Gus Eghneim conducted an EH&S Audit of this facility in Garfield, New Jersey on 12/12/00. +2000 Peaker Facilities (Lincoln Center, Gleason & Wheatland) ) Scott Watson provided responses and pertinent information to Ross Newlin regarding Safety/Health training issues at these facilities for Allegheny Power. Semiannual Reports for Caledonia and New Albany ) Ramiro Garcia completed and submitted to the state revisions to the semiannual environmental reports for the first part of 2000.  Revisions included more detailed information (i.e., reasons) for each period of excess emissions. REGULATORY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS Texas Upset and Notification Environmental Notice - Marc Phillips distributed an Environmental Notice to ETS personnel regarding the revisions to the Texas upset and maintenance notification rules which are applicable to compressor stations. TNRCC Stakeholders Meeting - Marc Phillips attended a TNRCC stakeholders meeting regarding draft revisions to a rule that would define maintenance and also restrict the use of a general permit often used by ETS personnel to authorize methane emissions from pipeline maintenance. Sustainable Development Meeting - Marc Phillips represented Enron at the Winter 2000 meeting of the Business Council for Sustainable Development -Gulf of Mexico. NPDES Multi-Sector General Permit --  Jim Peterson distributed an information email on the EPA reissuance of the NPDES multi-sector general permit for storm water discharges associated with industrial activities to Enron environmental personnel in affected states. DOT Amendments to Hours of Service (HOS) Regulations - Russell Tucker, with assistance from Jeff Keeler, issued comments to the DOT on behalf of Enron ETS concerning the adverse impact the current proposed amendments to the HOS regulation would have on the company's ability to operate and respond to emergencies without an unreasonable increase in operating costs. Petition for Extension of Time - Russell Tucker asked the NAM OSHA Steering Committee to consider joining Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC) in asking OSHA through a letter of petition for an extension of time to establish full compliance with the Ergonomics Program Grandfather clause . The request is under NAM legal review to ensure standing suits against OSHA in connection with the Ergonomics Program final rule would not be adversely affected. ANSI Z10 API Task Force Membership - Russell Tucker has accepted a request from API to be a member of the task force who will act as a committee member to the ANSI Z10 Full Committee starting proceedings to establish an Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems Standard. This standard is expected to be adopted as part of the international ISO certification standards after acceptance by ANSI and likely to affect any revival of the once proposed OSHA rule making on the same subject. COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE Clean Air - EPA Mercury Determination:   On Thursday, 12/14, EPA issued its mercury determination, deciding there is a need to regulate mercury emissions from power plants and laying out a timetable for developing the necessary regulations.  EPA indicated that it would consider ""flexible"" measures for complying with regulations, including trading, but no further details were included in the determination.  Jeff Keeler provided information on this regulation to Enron Americas power trading and origination, EGM coal/emissions traders, EES and other corporate groups. Clean Air - Section 126 Rule Litigation:   Federal District court in D.C. will hear oral arguments on Friday, 12/15 on the EPA's section 126 rule, which grants relief to northeast states who petitioned for greater control of NOx at sources in ""upwind"" states.   The federal Section 126 rule is scheduled to go into effect for sources in May 2003 -- 1 year sooner than similar state-developed regulations will go into effect for the same sources under the NOx SIP Call.  The outcome of the litigation is important because a ruling for industry could give sources another year to plan for emissions controls.  Jeff Keeler will issue a report on the litigation to Enron Americas, EGM, EIM, EES, and other impacted corporate groups. Power Quality/Distributed Generation:  Stacey Bolton and Mary Schoen continued to provide assistance to EES' Premium Power group as they look at environmental drivers for their business model.  Stacey delivered detailed information on federal incentive programs for distributed generation and Mary provided assistance and analysis of environmental regulations in EES' target states. EPA Green Power RFI:   Stacey Bolton provided information to EES (Richard Ring) in response to an RFI for the supply of green power to EPA in Ohio. (Part of the information that will be included in the RFI response will be the Enron EHS annual report).   Stacey also talked with APX about their exchange in Ohio and the potential for EES to price out a deal for green credits to use in the potential deal w/ EPA.  APX is very interested in doing a deal w/ EES, and has landfill credits for EES to bid on.  Stacey provided this information to EES. Renewable Energy Credits:  Stacey organized a conference call w/EGM and EES supply desk to discuss potential partnerships with Clean Power Markets (Green Credit Exchange and Verification company).  EES will likely become an anchor customer of the exchange.  Followed up with Richard Shapiro, Jim Steffes and Lisa Yoho regarding the potential partnership (Clean Power Markets had originally approached Rick about a partnership & he passed it along to Stacey.) ADVOCACY/COMMERCIAL SUPPORT Clean Air - NOx SIP Call:  Mary Schoen continued work on development of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) in several key Enron States, including Illinois, Tennessee, and Indiana.   States had until October 31, 2000 to submit SIPs to EPA for approval or face preemption by federal NOx rules, but EPA informally extended that deadline until the end of the year.  Mary is submitting comments to these states as they prepare their final SIPs. Tennessee:  will be less of a priority with the sale of the Brownsville peaker to Cinergy, but the work done by Mary in the SIP development process which gained allocation of allowances to Enron assets proved to be valuable in the sale. Indiana:  Mary is working with EES to ensure allocation of allowances to ""energy efficiency"" projects, which could prove to have value for EES and customers. Environmental Disclosure/Labeling:   as EES will be entering Ohio on 1/1/01 in First Energy's territory, Stacey Bolton met with the EES reporting team concerned about the label.   Stacey suggested that since First Energy is doing the billing function for EES' customers, EES lay off the disclosure requirement on First Energy (First Energy will also be purchasing and delivering the power).  EES is attempting to implement this suggestion.   EES is also actively looking at CG&E territory and needs to prepare a disclosure label.  As Ohio's disclosure rule is ambiguous, Stacey has been coordinating questions w/ Ohio PUCO staff regarding disclosure requirements. Renewable Energy/Wind:  Stacey is working with Enron Americas West Desk on trading opportunities for wind energy in the west.  DOE is organizing a trading platform for the Western States, and Stacey provided information to EA and is helping develop a strategy to optimize their value for wind energy. Pipeline Safety Legislation:    In Congress' last minute efforts to pass appropriations bills, rumors have circulated that there may be an attempt to attach pipeline safety legislation.   Jeff Keeler worked to gather more information on these efforts, and found that support of many key congressional leaders for such an effort is missing.  Jeff forwarded to ETS and others a letter sent by Senator John McCain (a key pipeline safety proponent) to congressional leaders) urging that pipeline legislation not be included in any appropriations bills. GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS Cuiaba Pipeline (Bolivia/Brazil)- Joe Kolb will be participating with Catherine McKalip-Thompson (Enron Corp) in conducting a ""lessons learned"" analysis for the Cuiaba Project  and Transredes oil spill. Lagos EPP (Nigeria) - Joe Kolb reports that the refurbishing and conversion of the power barges is behind schedule.  The first one is expected to go online in March of 2001 and the last in November 2001. RioGen/Eletrobolt PPs (Brazil)- Joe Kolb has discussed with Lauren Goldblatt (Enron Corp) the perspective he gleaned from his inspection of the proposed CEG pipeline that will provide natural gas to the RioGen/Eletrobolt projects.  Lauren is working with Enron SA to arrange a community meeting. ACQUISITIONS Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington Pulp and Paper Acquisition) -  Susan Worthen was notified by Gustavo Junqueira (Industrial Markets Finance Manager) that this transaction has been approved by the Board and Enron is in the final stages of negotiating the Share Purchase Agreement with the Seller.  The Port Angeles, Washington mill will be excluded due to environmental liability issues.  Additional environmental due diligence is currently being conducted on timber properties located near Quebec that are harvested for construction lumber.  Mark Greenberg (Industrial Markets Attorney) is the interface on the due diligence.  Gustavo, Susan, and Bob Anderson (Pulp and Paper Technical) met to discuss the transition process and on-going EHS support.  Susan also took the opportunity to raise questions regarding budgets and acquisition strategy for 2001. She agreed to provide transition plans for previous EI projects to use as ticklers of items that need to be addressed, such as payroll, conversion of accounting systems, HR, etc. and will meet with Henry Van and his group to discuss transition and operating support plans. Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania Power Plant Acquisition) - Don Stevens provided an interpretation of the impact of EPA's announcement regarding the control (regulation) of mercury emissions. Massey (JV Coal Mine) - The scheduled site visit by Don Stevens was cancelled by Massey due to disclosure concerns regarding current civil suits.  Massey's executive management apparently questioned Enron's interest in the spill since it is not directly associated with the property transaction currently being pursued.  Susan Worthen notified the project team and RAC representative of the current status and learned that this transaction will not be concluded by the end of the year and additional time would be available in January to visit these issues. North Carolina CF Power Plants - Don Stevens reviewed the ENSR draft Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, dated December 2000, and provided additional questions.  ENSR is currently conducting a limit Phase II and the report should be available by December 22, 2000. ISAGEN - Don Stevens reviewed Harza's ""Technical Review of ISAGEN Generating Plants"" and reported to  Mario Brunasso.  It has been reported that the Finance Minister of Columbia said that legal loopholes, possible changes in the price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30, 2001. Project Canary - Don Stevens reviewed Pilko & Associates Environmental Risk Identification for the Celgar Pulp Company.  Susan Worthen provided an Environmental Risk summary for the project team to use in the DASH. DEPARTMENT PROJECTS EHS Web Site - The website is currently on-line. On Friday, December15th, we will begin to promote the website on E-TV and also place a link to the site on home.enron.com in the New and Notable section and in the Intranet Site section.  Phase II planning is beginning. Phase II will contain streaming video, an International Legislative and Regulatory Database, access to a compliance management calendar and the remaining information from the Environmental Strategies Group. Phase II role out still needs to be determined and will be dependent on the availability of Enron Networks staff. Telework/NEPI Program - Gavin Dillingham represented Enron at a meeting in County Judge Eckels, office to discuss the National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act with NEPI and the Philadelphia Steering Committee. Gavin is also meeting with Elham Shirazi of NEPI and a representative from Enron,s transportation group to discuss the possibility and feasibility of Enron providing a Vanpool for its employees. Lifecycle Process - Gavin Dillingham is continuing to work with Susan Worthen and AD Little on determining Enron,s products and services for the lifecycle study.  Financial market trading activities will be segregated from physical market activities (those requiring a physical position in the market) and a glossary of trading terms will be provided to make the document easier to understand.  Additional refinements of the services will also be conducted to streamline the inventory. Asset Tracking Database - The database is currently being populated with data. Susan Worthen will be following up on the revision of the asset list. Annual EHS Report - Susan Worthen, Lauren Goldblatt, and Catherine McKalip-Thompson discussed data needs for the 2000 annual report.  Lauren and Susan met with Keith Micelli to gain insight on potential reporting issues and contacts for Transredes and Cuiaba.  Lou Soldano and Susan Worthen agreed to set up a meeting in early January to discuss EHS reporting of EOTT assets with Frank Smith, Dave Nutt, and Bill Kendrick. ***********",0
"Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to impose gas price caps. Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most likely choose not to for price reasons. Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000. Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 May  820 Jun-Jul  980 Aug  1050 Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full) During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted ""windowing,"" lowering the ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level (even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D). El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at the south system delivery point. 2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there is no need for new capacity (CP99-522). Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion). ***********",1

While both calls were cut short, after I talked to Mitch he was encouraging us to go with our original sur-rebuttle and not with the revised Ruelle testimony.  At the same time Pamela was worried that we needed to stick with the original sur-rebuttle and to incorporate the changes that she felt were important to make.  My concern all along is that we correctly inform the OPUC as to the facts in Nevada while at the same time getting this transaction closed.  It seems to me that the common wisdom of those closest to the OPUC and the OPUC staff is to file the sur-rebuttle that outlines our plans for the PGE acquistion and rate plan, responds to staffs concerns raised in their rebuttle and to do so on Monday.  Pamela suggested that we could inform all of the parties, which includes the OPUC of the events that are likely to be disclosed on Monday via letter.   During our conversation it was clear that Mitch had concerns about using the rebuttle testimony as the way to convey our current status in Nevada to the parties in Oregon.  I would like to suggest that we follow the advice that we are getting from PGE and Enron on this as they are closest to the OPUC staff and others in Oregon.  We will need to add a couple of paragraphs to Mark's testimony that will make what he testifys to in District Court on Monday consistant with the sur-rebuttle in Oregon.  We will go back to my original sur-rebuttle as improved by PGE, Enron, yourself and Beth for filing on Monday.  Coupled with the responses we make to the OPUC staff next week on the recent data requests we can make sure that we have informed all parties of the critical facts in Nevada.  This all makes sense to me as we will know more on Monday after the District Court hearing in Nevada, we will have made our press release and energy filing in Nevada and all parties will then be informed as to the nature of whats going on.  I am still hopeful that we will have resolution to the situation in Nevada in a timly manner but I cannot be sure of it.  Thanks for the hard work this weekend on the tough issues and for your advice in how best to get the deal with PGE closed soon.   steve oldham -----Original Message----- From: Jonathan Ater [mailto:Jaa@aterwynne.com] Sent: Saturday, July 08, 2000 1:02 PM To: belliot@sppc.com; dponn@sppc.com; mruelle@sppc.com; soldham@sppc.com; wpeterson@sppc.com Subject: Important - Further Information I have just learned informally from Mike Morgan that Enron is likely to take the position that the 10AM version of Ruelle is not a best efforts presentation.

In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's ""Chief Regulatory Office"" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss. Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) ""Deal Bench"" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

It has been my experience that such open discussion of market design issues, with full pursuit of any problematic features, is essential in achieving a successful electricity market.  Unfortunately, the subject is complex and the details matter.  It is not possible to anticipate every problem, but the evidence shows that ignoring obvious problems in the hope that the rules can be easily adapted has not been a successful strategy.  This makes what you are doing all the more important. On reflection after the workshop, I am more concerned about the argument that emerged about the role of the ISO.  In many instances, to explain away problems of the type identified by Shmuel Oren, an argument was made that some administrative rule along with discretionary choices of the ISO would counteract perverse incentives created by the pricing system.  If this argument were correct, it would seem to place a substantial burden on the ISO to undo what the pricing incentives have done.  When faced with such conditions in California and elsewhere, the ISO developed a more and more intrusive role in what became less and less of a market.  To make this unhappy practice part of the official design, to the point that the ISO is expected to ignore the information in schedules and do what is right, would seem to be especially problematic.  At a minimum, it would make the ISO responsible for any difficulties that develop, without giving the ISO the market tools to avoid the problems. Commissioner Wood asked at what point how a coordinated spot market would differ from the ERCOT protocols.  We pursued the most important feature--eliminating the balanced schedule requirement--but did not have time to pursue all the other details.  The presentation I handed out contains a summary of the key features on page 20.  After the workshop, I received an email with a recent presentation by John Chandley, a colleague of mine, that addresses the issues of market design with a focus on California.  As I indicated in Austin, there are important differences between ERCOT and California, but on the matter of wholesale market design there is a great deal in common, such as requiring balanced schedules, relying on congestion zones, applying different treatment for different kinds of congestion, using ad hoc pricing rules, and so on.  John's summary of the recommended reforms for California would apply in large part to the ERCOT protocols.  I have attached a copy of this presentation for your information. I remain both impressed with all that you have accomplished to date, and worried that fundamental assumptions in the market design will recreate problems that we have seen elsewhere.  My recommendation to adopt a coordinated spot market more like PJM won't solve all problems, but it would go a long way.  Whatever the difficulty now, it will be much harder to fix these problems later.  Furthermore, the coordinated spot market role for the ISO is much more robust.  If the simplifying assumptions of the ERCOT protocols are true (which I doubt), the coordinated spot market will end up looking much like the zonal model with a few constraints and easy bilateral trading.  But if the ERCOT assumptions are wrong, the ERCOT protocols will face serious problems and the coordinated spot market would be a solution.  Furthermore, we now know from experience that the coordinated spot market is neither more complicated nor more expensive than the alternatives.  The sooner you make a commitment in Texas to adopt this successful market design, the better. I offer these further remarks as I did my comments yesterday, in the hope that you succeed.  I would be happy to discuss these matters further, as you decide. Best Regards, William W. Hogan 79 John F. Kennedy Street Cambridge, MA 02138 p.s.

"PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential."" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. ""The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, "" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that."" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. ""We're almost like a David against Goliath here,"" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. ""The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control."" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its ""Peak Corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,"" said Nelson. ""It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. ""It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse."" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. ""In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said SMUD's Posner. ""But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal."" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks,  they said. ***********",1

Thanks. DJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and customers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday. A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating the wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the ""expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done."" ""Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court to decide if generators should refund money,"" the commissioner said. ""I don't think the state is willing to spend the money or the time."" In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their ratepayers, the commissioner said. A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added. Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires. Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said rates were ""unjust and unreasonable."" The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in order to drive up wholesale power prices. The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers. The commissioner said ""if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the utilities would be left holding the bag."" PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a state-mandated rate freeze. As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay off employees and reduce major capital spending. PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-11-00 ***********",1

My time trial shows it takes 6 min and 45 seconds to deliver.  We need to cut. Dan, can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies?  Send me the front end from last week's filing supporting EPSA's motion. I'll take comments up to 12 noon Wednesday. gba ============================= The Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) is a California non-profit trade association of almost thirty members who sell, buy and exchange power throughout the Western U.S.  We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week. 1. Price caps and their unintended consequences 2. Forward scheduling, penalties, mandatory must-buy, and 3. Independent Governing Boards. First, I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order.  The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer, and equally upset by the actions of non-jurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring, and drive it into the ground. As I listened to your comments last week, I took note of all the things you said, and the stated purpose of your actions.  After listening to you, and reading the Order, I very much wanted to be here today, even if it only afforded me a brief 5-minutes of your time.  I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly.  And that phrase would be ""Thank you. Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive California's wholesale power market.  Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving, and absent of any national policy goals."" This Commission took a stab at correcting California's problems utilizing several measures, one of which was a $150 price cap.  Whereas we applaud the Commission's effort,  we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load.  We have found that price caps misallocate resources, and as your Staff report demonstrates, increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists.  We find that price caps discourage demand-side participation, and at the level proposed, will discourage much needed peaking generation resources.  We also find that any price cap, but especially at the level you have proposed, will create unintended consequences.  For example, when market bids exceed $150, sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX.  Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX, such as APX, or AlTrade?  Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates, and above which the bilateral market prevails?  That is a huge hammer, a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another. WPTF has been against price caps, and continues to believe that price caps do much damage, and do not protect consumers.  The damages include prolonging high prices, reducing price discovery, and reducing the quantity of long-term offers that otherwise would afford consumers much-needed price protection.  Average prices do not diminish with caps, in fact, as you know, August prices in California were much higher than last June, even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was $250 instead of $750. We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators don't like price spikes, and caps are a quick solution.  If you feel that price caps must be imposed, then limit the damage.  We believe that Commissioner Hebert's price cap proposal which starts at $250, and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging.  We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand, or fuel price would be the most harmful.  Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance.  The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability, and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability.  On the other hand, floating price caps work in the opposite direction.  They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty, and lessen stability.  If price caps are at all necessary, stick to the least damaging approach. WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand, the imposition of real-time penalties, and we support elimination of the must-buy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision.  Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation, and reduced grid reliability.  Mandatory pre-scheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to real-time resolution.  Also, by eliminating the must-buy provision, the UDCs can no longer complain about ""supply not showing up"". Their avenues for finding cost-effective supply will be unlimited. Finally, we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members.  Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board, we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems. The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems.  But it is asking too much, we think, to spare one and eliminate the other.  The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring.  Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates, the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board, and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the well-being of the very institution on whose Board they serve. We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough.  There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers, but in fact, are making a power grab.  My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect, if we have evidence, if we detect, or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board, I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest. The California market simply can not survive serving two masters.  The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders 888, and 2000. Thank you. ***********",1
"Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market. In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a ""problem"" that requires ""emergency"" amendments to the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage new generation development. Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he would try to pull together a ""terms of reference"" document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow. After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas: 1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis; 2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA; 3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies. Please advise if you have any comments. Regards, Rob ***********",0

"Executive Summary: £ Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B £ The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component £ Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature £ The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end £ PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court. 1. Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal According to sources, the Assembly is ""terrified""  of the current holes in the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward. Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  ""not that far off""; it will likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is introduced. 2. What Would the New Plan B Look Like? - This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state is ""fairly confident"" that at least most generators  would not be successful in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from within his office. 3. Transmission Lines - It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the Assembly is ""working on  this."" 4. Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate - According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet settled) ""looks very good.""  The vote in the Senate would  be ""very close."" Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly ""pessimistic"" about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point. 5. Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End - As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents on the dollar. - Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, since it would pay back most of what they are  owed. 6. PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In - If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can be offered at any time within  PG&E's ""period of exclusivity.""  This is a 90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition. - However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high. 7. Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure - Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, this plan does not make the crisis go  away. ***********",1

CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES SELL POWER TO PG&amp;E UNDER THE TERMS OF LONG-TERM QF CONTRACTS AT ELEVEN FACILITIES, REPRESENTING NEARLY 600 MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER CUSTOMERS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2001, CALPINE HAS RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH PG&amp;E, PLUS A $68 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE NOT YET DUE AND PAYABLE.  THE COMPANY'S REMAINING CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 700 MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY, PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER CREDITWORTHY THIRD PARTIES. CALPINE'S QF FACILITIES ARE PART OF A 9,000-MEGAWATT QF SUPPLY THAT PROVIDE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WITH A LONG-TERM SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AT PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICES.  THIS CRITICAL POWER SUPPLY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POWER DEMAND.  WITHOUT THESE CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR THIS SUMMER, CALIFORNIA FACES THE PROSPECT OF MORE BLACKOUTS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCREASED COSTS. FOR THESE QF CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE, PG&amp;E MUST ASSUME THE CONTRACTS IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.  IN ORDER TO ASSUME THESE CONTRACTS, PG&amp;E WILL BE REQUIRED TO CURE ALL OUTSTANDING DEFAULTS, INCLUDING PAYING ALL PAST DUE AMOUNTS.  IF PG&amp;E FAILS TO ASSUME THE CONTRACTS, CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE ABLE TO SELL POWER ON THE OPEN MARKET AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM PG&amp;E FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROCESS.

"Steve, The Secretary of Energy Ernesto Martens used to be the CEO of VITRO, our client in for the Monterrey Project.  He was a board member until the day of his appointment.  He knows Enron well.  He used to be the President and CEO of CINTRA the holding company for Mexicana and Aeromexico airlines.  When I worked at McKinsey I was engaged in projects with CINTRA for two years. Martens has a reputation of being a good and tough manager.  He delivers. On the other hand he also has a reputation of being stubborn and not a good negotiator.  We still have to convince him of the proposed electric sector reorganization. The good news is that Fox used many of the phrases that we wrote in the documents for the transition team.  Apparently he is following the script. When he talks about no privatization he limits it by saying: there will be no sell out of CFE's current assets and by ensuring that the sector will be open to competition. Dionisio P,rez- Jacome was appointed President of the FERC.  He is a classmate of Steffes from the Kennedy School and a good friend of mine. All of the team supporting him is Luis Tellez's team. The undersecretaries, the president of the CRE (FERC) the directors of CFE and LFC.  The only new face is the Director of PEMEX who used to be the President and CEO of DuPont in Mexico.  Raœl Muoz was very helpful in promoting electric deregulation. About a year ago he organizad a trip to Altamira in the state of Tamaulipas in which he invited members of Congress to visit the DuPont and the BASF plants there so they could see the size of the investments and what was at risk if deregulation did not take place.  Jaime Alatorre and I were the only non Congress, non-DuPont or BASF people invited.  He and Alatorre are very very good friends.  I spent some time with him yesterday at a conference in which I presented a document on energy and economic development and he invited me to his office to discuss competition in natural gas. CFE and LFC have the same directors which may  make change more difficult btu it is inevitable.

( February 14, 2001 ) Feb. 14--SACRAMENTO, Calif.--As Gov. Gray Davis works to craft a bailout plan for California's two largest electric utilities, California's fledgling foray into the power business is coming at an ever more expensive price that is nearing $2 billion. For the second time in about a week, the Davis administration alerted lawmakers Tuesday that it needs another $500 million to buy energy on the costly short-term market while negotiators try to work out long-term contracts with power suppliers. That brings the two-month state price tag to about $2 billion, far exceeding early estimates that California would have to spend about $1 billion to launch its energy buying program. The news has left some lawmakers worried that the state is burning through money without making enough progress in resolving the underlying problems. With the bills piling up, Davis is looking to present Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric with a plan by week's end to rescue the two companies edging ever closer to bankruptcy. The state was forced to start buying power because the two utilities have exhausted their credit. For now, the governor's advisers appear to have decided on state ownership of the utility transmission lines as the foundation of any deal, according to sources involved in the negotiations. In a Tuesday press conference, Davis said he has not settled on transmission lines, but wants to make sure that the state gets something in return for rescuing the companies. ""What I will propose, hopefully this Friday, will not be a bailout, it will be a buyout,"" Davis said. Buying the transmission lines has become the most-favored option in the Capitol in recent days as what one consumer activist called the ""crown jewel"" of any solution. A state Senate committee formally embraced the idea Tuesday by approving a bare-bones bill that encourages Davis to buy the transmission lines as part of any utility deal. Several issues must be settled before a transmission line deal is final. It still isn't clear what the lines are worth, or whether the utilities will have to pay capital gains taxes on the lines if they sell them to the state. And under the law, the federal government may have veto power over any transmission line deal. But negotiators expressed confidence they can resolve those issues. However, the state is still struggling to put together low-cost, long-term contracts with power companies that are essential to keeping electric bills close to current levels. When legislators gave Davis the power last month to sign the energy deals, they set aside $500 million to tide the state over until it could get the contracts in place. That came on top of another $1 billion from other funds that have been used to buy energy that now costs about $45 million a day. California won't be able to stop spending so much until it signs enough long-term contracts. But negotiations have been plodding along and so far the state has managed to come up with only about 500 megawatts -- enough to power a half million homes. ""I am starting to get concerned about the pace at which they appear to be entering into contracts,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ""It is slow and there don't appear to be many of them."" Davis has released few details about the contracts, but has expressed optimism that his negotiators will be able to put together enough deals to solve the problems. ""No one ever expected this to be a slam dunk because it's a tough negotiation,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""But we're making progress."" Ultimately, the state is supposed to be reimbursed for its mounting expenditures in the spot market, under terms of a $10 billion power-buying bond bill approved by the legislature two weeks ago. The treasurer's office intends to sell the first of those bonds in May, and their proceeds will be transferred to the state general fund. Later bond issues will generate money to be used for the long-term contracts. Bond investors will be repaid by utility ratepayers, but it is not yet clear whether that will involve a rate increase.
